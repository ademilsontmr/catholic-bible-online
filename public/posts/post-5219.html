    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Emotional Bonds</h2>
<p>The Catholic understanding of strengthening emotional bonds in marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Song of Songs 2:16: "My beloved is mine and I am his." This beautiful passage from the Song of Songs shows that emotional bonds in marriage are not just about feelings but are about a deep, mutual belonging and commitment. When couples understand that they belong to each other in this way, they are better able to strengthen their emotional connection and build a relationship that is truly intimate and loving.</p>
