    <article><h2>Introduction: Religious Liberty as Sacred Duty</h2><p>Catholic politicians have a sacred duty to protect religious liberty for all people, regardless of their faith. This duty flows from our recognition that religious liberty is a fundamental human right that flows from human dignity and that protecting this right is essential for building a just and compassionate society.</p><p>This protection is not about privileging one religion over others, but about ensuring that all people can live according to their religious beliefs without fear of discrimination or persecution. When Catholic politicians protect religious liberty, they become instruments of God's love and justice in the world.</p><h2>What Protecting Religious Liberty Entails</h2><p>Protecting religious liberty entails several things. First, it means working for laws that protect the right to worship according to conscience and to live one's faith in daily life. Second, it means ensuring that religious institutions can operate freely without undue government interference.</p><p>Third, it means protecting the right of parents to educate their children according to their religious beliefs. Fourth, it means ensuring that people are not discriminated against in employment, housing, or other areas because of their religious beliefs.</p><h2>Why This Duty Matters</h2><p>This duty matters for several reasons. First, religious liberty is a fundamental human right that must be protected for all people.

They help build a society that respects the dignity and worth of every human person.</p><h2>Prayer for Religious Liberty</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help Catholic politicians to fulfill their duty to protect religious liberty. Give them the wisdom to work for laws that protect this fundamental right, the courage to stand up against threats to religious liberty, and the charity to protect this right for all people. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
