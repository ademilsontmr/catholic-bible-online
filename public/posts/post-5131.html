    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: The Sacramental Character</h2><p>How does baptism imprint a sacramental character on the soul? This question addresses one of the most profound aspects of the sacrament of baptism. Revelation 7:3 provides a biblical foundation for this understanding: 'Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.' This verse reveals that God marks His servants with a seal, which in Catholic theology corresponds to the sacramental character that baptism imprints on the soul.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that baptism imprints an indelible sacramental character on the soul, marking the baptized person as belonging to Christ forever. This character is not just symbolic but is a real spiritual reality that permanently configures the person to Christ and enables them to participate in the worship of the Church. This character can never be lost or repeated, making baptism a once-for-all sacrament.</p><h2>The Context of Revelation 7:3</h2><p>To understand how baptism imprints a sacramental character on the soul, we must examine the context of Revelation 7:3. This verse is part of the vision of the sealing of the servants of God before the great tribulation. The verse reads: 'Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.'</p><p>This verse shows that God marks His servants with a seal that identifies them as belonging to Him. This seal is not just external but is a mark that identifies the person as a servant of God.

The sacramental character is an indelible mark that is imprinted on the soul at baptism and can never be lost or erased. This character is not just symbolic but is a real spiritual reality that permanently configures the person to Christ.</p><p>This indelible mark is the reason why baptism cannot be repeated. Once a person is baptized, they are permanently marked as belonging to Christ, and this mark can never be removed or repeated.
