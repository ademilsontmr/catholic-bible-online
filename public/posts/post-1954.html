After completing all five decades, pray three times: 'Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.'</p><h2>The Power and Promises of the Divine Mercy Chaplet</h2><p>Jesus made many specific promises to those who pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet with trust and devotion.
