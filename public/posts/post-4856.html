    <article><h2>Striving for Sainthood: God's Universal Call</h2><p>Sainthood is not just for a select few but is God's universal call to all people. Every person is called to be a saint, regardless of their circumstances, background, or past. Understanding striving for sainthood as God's universal call helps you recognize that holiness is not just for priests and religious but is possible and expected for everyone. This understanding is deeply rooted in Catholic teaching, where we are all called to be saints and to grow in holiness.</p><h2>The Biblical Foundation: Be Holy as I Am Holy</h2><p>The Bible teaches us about God's universal call to holiness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 tells us, 'But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: 'Be holy, because I am holy.'' Additionally, Matthew 5:48 records Jesus saying, 'Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.' Understanding this biblical foundation helps you recognize that holiness is not optional but is God's call to everyone.</p><h2>Understanding God's Universal Call</h2><p>God's universal call to sainthood means that every person, regardless of their circumstances, is called to grow in holiness and become a saint. This call is not just for priests and religious but for married people, single people, young people, old people, and people in every walk of life. God's call is personal and unique to each individual, but it is universal in that it applies to everyone. Understanding God's universal call helps you recognize that holiness is possible for you.</p><h2>How to Respond to God's Call</h2><p>Responding to God's call to sainthood involves recognizing that you are called to holiness, being willing to cooperate with God's grace, making a commitment to grow in holiness, seeking God's guidance and help, and being patient with the process of growth. Responding to God's call is not about being perfect immediately but about being willing to begin the journey and to keep growing. Understanding how to respond to God's call helps you recognize what this involves and how to begin.</p><h2>Obstacles to Responding to God's Call</h2><p>There are many obstacles to responding to God's call to sainthood, including the belief that holiness is not possible for you, fear of the effort and sacrifice involved, misunderstanding of what holiness means, lack of knowledge about how to grow in holiness, and the tendency to compare yourself to others. Understanding these obstacles helps you recognize what might prevent you from responding to God's call and develop strategies for overcoming them.</p><h2>Prayer for Responding to God's Call</h2><p>Prayer is essential for responding to God's call to sainthood. Through prayer, you can ask for the grace to respond to God's call, seek His guidance and help, express your desire to grow in holiness, and receive the strength you need to persevere in your spiritual journey. Prayer also helps you recognize that responding to God's call is not just a human effort but requires God's grace and help. Understanding how to pray for responding to God's call helps you recognize the importance of prayer for spiritual growth.</p><h2>Practical Steps Toward Sainthood</h2><p>Practical steps toward sainthood include developing a regular prayer life, participating in the sacraments regularly, growing in virtue, serving others, learning about the faith, seeking spiritual guidance, and being open to God's grace and guidance. These steps are not about being perfect but about being willing to grow and to cooperate with God's grace. Understanding practical steps toward sainthood helps you develop a concrete approach to responding to God's call.</p><h2>The Joy of Striving for Sainthood</h2><p>Striving for sainthood brings joy and fulfillment, even in the midst of the effort and sacrifice involved. This joy comes from knowing that you are responding to God's call, growing in relationship with Him, and becoming the person He created you to be. The joy of striving for sainthood helps you persevere in your spiritual journey and find meaning and purpose in your life. Understanding the joy of striving for sainthood helps you recognize why this call is worth responding to.</p><h2>Conclusion: Answering God's Call</h2><p>Striving for sainthood as God's universal call is about recognizing that holiness is possible for everyone and that God is calling you to grow in holiness and become a saint. By understanding God's universal call, recognizing how to respond to it, overcoming obstacles, using prayer to support your response, taking practical steps, and experiencing the joy of striving for sainthood, you can respond to God's call and grow in holiness. Understanding this approach helps you recognize that sainthood is not just for a select few but is God's call to everyone, including you.</p></article>
