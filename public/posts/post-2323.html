    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Mental Health Ministry</h2><p>Mental health ministry is deeply rooted in Scripture and Catholic teaching about the whole person and God's care for our emotional and psychological well-being. The Bible is filled with stories of people who experienced mental and emotional challenges, from David's psalms of depression to Job's struggle with suffering. Jesus Himself showed compassion to those who were suffering emotionally and psychologically, healing not just physical ailments but also emotional wounds.

This biblical foundation shows us that mental health ministry is not separate from spiritual care, but an integral part of caring for the whole person.</p><h2>Understanding Catholic Mental Health Ministry</h2><p>Catholic mental health ministry provides spiritual support and pastoral care to individuals and families dealing with mental health challenges.
