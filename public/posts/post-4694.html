Understanding God's providence helps Catholics live with confidence in God's care.</p><h2>Call to Generosity and Sharing</h2><p>The miracle calls Catholics to practice generosity and sharing, essential virtues in Catholic life. The boy's willingness to share his small lunch demonstrates the importance of offering what we have to God and others.
