    <article><h2>Introduction: Baptism and the Easter Vigil</h2><p>What is the connection between baptism and the Easter Vigil? This question addresses one of the most beautiful aspects of the Catholic liturgical tradition. Romans 6:3-4 provides the biblical foundation for this understanding: 'Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.' These verses reveal the profound connection between baptism and the paschal mystery of Christ's death and resurrection.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that the Easter Vigil is the most appropriate time for baptism because it celebrates the paschal mystery that baptism makes present. Through baptism, we participate in Christ's death and resurrection, and the Easter Vigil is the time when the Church most fully celebrates this mystery. The connection between baptism and the Easter Vigil is not just liturgical but is deeply theological and spiritual.</p><h2>The Context of Romans 6:3-4</h2><p>To understand the connection between baptism and the Easter Vigil, we must examine the context of Romans 6:3-4.
