    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Homeless Ministry</h2><p>Homeless ministry is deeply rooted in Scripture and Catholic teaching about caring for the poor and vulnerable. The Bible repeatedly calls us to care for the poor, the homeless, and those who are in need. Matthew 25:35-40 tells us that when we care for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned, we are caring for Christ Himself. Jesus Himself had no place to lay His head and showed special care for those who were marginalized and in need. Catholic teaching emphasizes that every person has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their circumstances, and that we are called to serve those who are most in need. This biblical foundation shows us that homeless ministry is not just about providing services, but about living out our faith through love and service to those who are suffering.</p><h2>Understanding Catholic Homeless Ministry</h2><p>Catholic homeless ministry provides spiritual, emotional, and practical support to individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness.
