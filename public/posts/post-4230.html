These pieces of evidence help us understand the nature and significance of their relationship.</p><p>One of the most significant pieces of evidence is John's designation as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' This designation appears five times in the Gospel of John (13:23, 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, 21:20), and it suggests a level of intimacy and affection that was unique among the disciples.

This privileged position suggests that Jesus trusted John and valued his presence at these important moments.</p><p>Another piece of evidence is John's presence at the Last Supper, where he is described as reclining next to Jesus (John 13:23). This position of intimacy suggests that John had a special place in Jesus' affections and that Jesus trusted him with His most intimate moments. The fact that John was able to lean back against Jesus and ask about the identity of the betrayer suggests a level of closeness and trust that was unique among the disciples.</p><p>Another piece of evidence is Jesus' entrusting of His mother Mary to John's care while He was on the cross (John 19:26-27).
