    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Mary in the Infancy Narratives</h2><p>The Gospels present Mary as central to the incarnation story, beginning with the Annunciation in Luke's Gospel. Catholic tradition sees Mary's 'yes' to God's plan as the model of perfect faith and obedience. Her role as the Mother of God (Theotokos) is foundational to Catholic understanding of the incarnation and the dignity of human nature. Mary's presence in the infancy narratives shows her importance in God's plan of salvation.</p><h2>The Annunciation and Mary's Fiat</h2><p>Luke's account of the Annunciation (1:26-38) shows Mary as the model of faith and discipleship. Her response, 'Let it be done to me according to your word,' represents perfect cooperation with God's grace. Catholic teaching emphasizes that Mary's fiat (let it be done) is the pattern for all Christian discipleship. Her willingness to accept God's plan, despite the challenges it would bring, shows the depth of her faith and trust in God.</p><h2>Mary's Magnificat</h2><p>Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) is one of the most important texts in Catholic tradition. This song of praise reveals Mary's deep understanding of God's plan and her role in it. Catholic interpretation sees the Magnificat as expressing God's preferential option for the poor and His commitment to justice. Mary's song emphasizes how God 'has scattered the proud' and 'exalted those of low degree,' establishing themes that will be central to Jesus' ministry.</p><h2>Mary at the Wedding at Cana</h2><p>John's Gospel presents Mary at the wedding at Cana (2:1-11), where she intercedes for the couple and prompts Jesus' first miracle. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary's role as intercessor and showing her concern for human needs. Her instruction to the servants, 'Do whatever he tells you,' is seen as Mary's ongoing message to all believers. This episode reveals Mary's maternal care for the Church and her role in bringing people to Jesus.</p><h2>Mary at the Foot of the Cross</h2><p>John's Gospel places Mary at the foot of the cross (19:25-27), where Jesus entrusts her to the beloved disciple and the disciple to her. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary as the Mother of the Church and showing her participation in Christ's redemptive work. Her presence at the cross demonstrates her complete identification with Jesus' mission and her willingness to share in His suffering.</p><h2>Mary in the Early Church</h2><p>Acts 1:14 shows Mary present with the apostles in the Upper Room after Jesus' ascension, praying for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary's role in the birth of the Church and her ongoing intercession for the Church. Her presence with the apostles shows her importance in the early Christian community and her role as a model of prayer and discipleship.</p><h2>Mary's Perpetual Virginity</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary's perpetual virginity is based on the Gospels' presentation of her as 'the virgin' and the early Church's understanding of her unique role. The Gospels show Mary as set apart for God's special purpose, and Catholic tradition sees her virginity as a sign of her complete dedication to God's will. This teaching emphasizes the sacredness of Mary's role in salvation history.</p><h2>Mary as the New Eve</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees Mary as the new Eve, whose obedience to God reverses the disobedience of the first Eve. Just as Eve's 'no' to God brought sin into the world, Mary's 'yes' to God brings salvation. This typological interpretation helps Catholics understand Mary's role in God's plan of redemption and her importance in salvation history.</p><h2>Mary and the Communion of Saints</h2><p>Catholic teaching on the communion of saints sees Mary as the first among the saints and a model for all believers. Her assumption into heaven and her role as Queen of Heaven show her participation in the fullness of God's life. Catholic tradition emphasizes that Mary's glorification is a sign of hope for all believers and a preview of the resurrection of the body.</p><h2>Contemporary Devotion to Mary</h2><p>Modern Catholic devotion to Mary is based on the Gospel accounts of her role in salvation history. The Rosary, Marian feasts, and other devotions help Catholics grow in their relationship with Mary and through her to Jesus. Catholic teaching emphasizes that devotion to Mary always leads to Jesus and helps believers grow in their faith and discipleship.</p></article>
