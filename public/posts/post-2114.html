    <article><h2>The Importance of Prayer Before Surgery</h2><p>Facing surgery can be one of the most challenging and anxiety-provoking experiences in life. Whether it's a minor procedure or major surgery, the uncertainty, fear, and vulnerability we feel can be overwhelming. However, the Catholic Church teaches that prayer before surgery is not just a comfort, but a powerful spiritual tool that can bring peace, strength, and God's protection during this difficult time.</p><p>Prayer before surgery helps us to surrender our fears and anxieties to God, to trust in His healing power, and to find peace in knowing that we are not alone. It also helps us to prepare spiritually for the procedure, recognizing that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and that God is actively involved in our healing process.</p><p>Throughout history, countless Catholics have found comfort and strength through prayer before surgery, experiencing God's peace that surpasses all understanding even in the most challenging medical situations.</p><h2>Biblical Foundation for Prayer Before Surgery</h2><p>The Bible contains many passages that speak to God's care for the sick and His power to heal. These verses provide comfort and hope for those facing surgery:</p><h3>Psalm 23:4</h3><p>"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me." This verse reminds us that God is with us even in the most difficult and frightening situations.</p><h3>Isaiah 41:10</h3><p>"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." This verse provides assurance of God's presence and support during difficult times.</p><h3>Philippians 4:6-7</h3><p>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This passage shows that prayer brings peace that goes beyond human understanding.</p><h3>James 5:14-15</h3><p>"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up." This verse shows the power of prayer and the importance of community support.</p><h3>Matthew 8:17</h3><p>"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: 'He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.'" Jesus took upon Himself our sufferings and illnesses, showing His deep compassion for the sick.</p><h2>Prayer Before Surgery for Peace of Mind</h2><p>Here is a powerful prayer to say before surgery:</p><h3>Main Prayer Before Surgery</h3><p>Heavenly Father, I come before You today as I prepare for surgery, asking for Your protection, guidance, and peace.
