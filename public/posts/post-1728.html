    <article><h2>Introduction: Dignity Until the End</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on end-of-life care and dignity represent a compassionate and principled approach to one of the most challenging aspects of human life. The Catholic understanding of end-of-life care emphasizes that every human person maintains their inherent dignity from conception to natural death, and that this dignity must be respected and protected even in the final stages of life. This perspective challenges modern approaches that often prioritize convenience or cost over human dignity, instead presenting a framework for end-of-life care that honors the sanctity of life while providing compassionate care for the dying and their families. When we understand Catholic perspectives on end-of-life care and dignity, we develop a more compassionate and principled approach to caring for those who are dying.</p><p>The Catholic approach to end-of-life care emphasizes that dying persons are not just patients or cases, but human persons with inherent dignity who deserve respect, care, and love until the moment of natural death.
