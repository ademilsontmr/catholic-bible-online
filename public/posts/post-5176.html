    <h1>How God Designed Marriage from the Beginning (Matthew 19:4–6)</h1>
    <p><em>2025-01-27</em></p>
    <article><h2>God's Original Design</h2>
<p>Marriage is not a human invention but is part of God's original design for creation. This is clearly expressed in Matthew 19:4–6, where Jesus quotes from Genesis: "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."</p>

<p>This passage shows that marriage is not just a cultural institution that has evolved over time but is part of God's plan from the very beginning. God created human beings as male and female and designed them to be united in marriage. This divine origin gives marriage its sacred character and its indissoluble nature.</p>

<h2>The Creation Account</h2>
<p>God's design for marriage is revealed in the creation account in Genesis. When God created the first man, He saw that it was not good for him to be alone. God then created the first woman as a suitable partner for the man. This creation of woman from man's rib symbolizes the intimate connection that should exist between husband and wife.</p>

<p>The creation account also shows that both man and woman are created in the image and likeness of God. This means that their relationship should reflect the love and unity that exists within the Trinity. The complementarity of male and female is not accidental but is part of God's design for human flourishing.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Marriage</h2>
<p>God designed marriage for several purposes. First, marriage is meant to provide companionship and mutual support. The man and woman are called to help each other grow in holiness and to support each other in their journey toward God. Second, marriage is meant to be fruitful, allowing couples to participate in God's creative work by bringing new life into the world.</p>

<p>Third, marriage is meant to be a sign of God's love to the world. The love between husband and wife should reflect the love that God has for humanity. This love is meant to be self-sacrificing, faithful, and life-giving, just as God's love is.</p>

<h2>The Unity of Marriage</h2>
<p>God designed marriage to be a union of two persons who become one flesh. This unity is not just physical but is spiritual, emotional, and intellectual as well. The couple is called to be one in their relationship with God, in their mission in the world, and in their call to holiness.</p>

<p>This unity is meant to be permanent and indissoluble. Just as God is faithful to His people, so too are husband and wife called to be faithful to each other. This permanence gives couples the security they need to love each other freely and completely.</p>

<h2>The Complementarity of the Sexes</h2>
<p>God designed men and women to be complementary to each other. This complementarity is not just physical but includes differences in personality, temperament, and approach to life. These differences are meant to enrich the relationship and help the couple to grow together.</p>

<p>This complementarity is not about superiority or inferiority but about the different gifts that each person brings to the relationship. The man and woman are called to use their different gifts to serve each other and to build up their marriage. This mutual service reflects the self-giving love that exists within the Trinity.</p>

<h2>The Call to Fruitfulness</h2>
<p>God designed marriage to be fruitful, both in terms of children and in terms of spiritual fruit. Couples are called to be open to the gift of children and to raise them in the faith. They are also called to bear spiritual fruit through their love for each other and their service to others.</p>

<p>This fruitfulness is not limited to couples with children. All married couples are called to be fruitful in their love for each other and in their witness to the world. Their marriage becomes a sign of God's love and a source of blessing for others.</p>

<h2>The Mission of Marriage</h2>
<p>God designed marriage to have a mission in the world. Married couples are called to be witnesses to God's love and to help build up the kingdom of God. Their marriage becomes a sign of hope in a world that often misunderstands or rejects the true meaning of love.</p>

<p>This mission includes not just their relationship with each other but also their relationship with their children, their extended family, their friends, and their community. The couple is called to be a source of love, support, and encouragement for others.</p>

<h2>The Call to Holiness</h2>
<p>God designed marriage to be a path to holiness. Couples are called to help each other grow in holiness and to become saints together. This call to holiness is not separate from their married life but is fulfilled through it. Every aspect of their marriage becomes a means of growing in holiness.</p>

<p>This call to holiness is not a burden but is a gift. God gives couples the grace they need to become holy through their married life. Their love for each other becomes a means of growing closer to God and of becoming more like Christ.</p>

<h2>The Eternal Dimension</h2>
<p>God designed marriage to have eternal significance. While the physical aspect of marriage ends with death, the spiritual bond that was created through the sacrament of marriage endures. The couple's love for each other continues in heaven, where it is purified and perfected.</p>

<p>This eternal dimension gives couples hope and encouragement in their efforts to live according to God's design. They know that their love is not just for this life but is meant to last forever. This knowledge helps them to persevere in their efforts to grow in love and holiness.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Divine Gift</h2>
<p>Marriage is a divine gift that God designed from the beginning for the good of humanity and for His own glory. This divine origin gives marriage its sacred character and its importance in God's plan for salvation. As we reflect on God's design for marriage, let us remember that this design is not a burden but is a gift that helps us to understand and experience the depth of God's love.</p>

<p>Let us also remember that God's design for marriage is not just for our own benefit but is meant to be a sign of His love to the world. When we live according to God's design, we become witnesses to the power of His love to transform human relationships.</p></article>
