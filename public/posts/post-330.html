    <p><em>2024-01-28</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Saint Joseph's trust in God's plan was absolute and unwavering. Despite facing numerous challenges and uncertainties, he never doubted that God was in control and working for his good.</p><h2>Trust in Difficult Times</h2><p>When Joseph learned that Mary was with child, when he had to flee to Egypt, when he returned to Nazareth - in all these challenging situations, Joseph trusted that God had a plan and that it was good.</p><h2>Trust in Daily Life</h2><p>Joseph's trust wasn't just for major events. He trusted God to provide for his family's daily needs, to guide him in his work, and to help him be a good father and husband.</p><h2>Trust in God's Timing</h2><p>Joseph trusted not only in God's plan, but in God's timing. He didn't try to rush God's work or force things to happen. He waited patiently for God to reveal His will.</p><h2>Teaching Us to Trust</h2><p>Saint Joseph teaches us that trust in God's plan means surrendering our own plans and desires to God's will. It means believing that God knows what's best for us and will work everything for our good.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Saint Joseph, model of trust, help us to surrender our plans to God's plan. Teach us to trust in God's timing and to believe that He is always working for our good. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
