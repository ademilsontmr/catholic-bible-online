    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Couple Prayer</h2>
<p>The practice of praying together as a couple is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Matthew 18:20: "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." This passage shows that when couples pray together, Christ is present with them in a special way. This divine presence is not just a nice addition but is essential for the strength and holiness of the marriage. When couples pray together, they are not just talking to each other but are inviting God into their relationship.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that couple prayer is not just about asking for things but is about growing in intimacy with God and with each other. When couples pray together, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ. This prayer is not about being religious but is about being in relationship with God and with each other.</p>

<h2>Prayer as a Source of Unity</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is a powerful source of unity in marriage. When couples pray together, they are not just sharing a religious practice but are sharing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and desires with God and with each other. This sharing creates a bond that is deeper than any other form of communication.</p>

<p>This unity through prayer includes being united in faith, being united in hope, being united in love, and being united in the mission of marriage. When couples pray together, they are not just living together but are working together to build a strong and lasting marriage. This unity helps them to face challenges together and to grow together in holiness.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Couple Prayer</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes praying together in the morning, praying together before meals, praying together before bed, and praying together about important decisions. These daily practices of couple prayer build a strong foundation for the relationship.</p>

<p>This daily practice of couple prayer includes being willing to pray for each other's needs, being willing to pray for their marriage, being willing to pray for their children, being willing to pray for their extended family, and being willing to pray for the world. When couples pray together in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and lasting.</p>

<h2>Couple Prayer and Communication</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is closely connected to communication. When couples pray together, they are not just talking to God but are also communicating with each other about their spiritual lives, their hopes and dreams, their fears and concerns, and their love for each other. This communication helps couples to understand each other better and to grow closer together.</p>

<p>This communication through prayer includes being willing to share one's spiritual journey with one's spouse, being willing to discuss how God is working in one's life, being willing to share one's hopes and dreams with one's spouse, and being willing to share one's fears and concerns with one's spouse. When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are building intimacy and trust.</p>

<h2>Couple Prayer and Growth</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is essential for personal and spiritual growth. When couples pray together, they are growing in virtues like faith, hope, love, patience, and humility. These virtues help them to become better people and better spouses. They also help them to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>

<p>This growth through couple prayer includes growing in faith together, growing in hope together, growing in love together, growing in patience together, and growing in humility together. When couples grow together in these virtues, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

<h2>Couple Prayer and the Mission of Marriage</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is essential for fulfilling the mission of marriage. When couples pray together, they are better able to discern God's will for their marriage and to work together to fulfill that will. This prayer helps them to understand their vocation and to live it out with joy and faithfulness.</p>

<p>This mission through couple prayer includes being willing to pray for God's guidance in important decisions, being willing to pray for the strength to fulfill their vocation, being willing to pray for the grace to love each other as God loves them, and being willing to pray for the wisdom to raise their children in the faith. When couples pray together for these things, they are not just asking for help but are actively working to fulfill their mission.</p>

<h2>The Grace of Couple Prayer</h2>
<p>Praying together as a couple is not something that couples can do on their own but requires God's grace. Through the sacrament of marriage, couples receive the grace they need to pray together and to grow in holiness. This grace is not just given once at the wedding but is available throughout their married life.</p>

<p>Couples can access this grace through prayer, participation in the sacraments, and a commitment to living according to God's will. With God's help, any couple can learn to pray together and to build a strong and lasting marriage based on prayer and love.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Sacred Practice</h2>
