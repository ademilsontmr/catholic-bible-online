    <article><h2>The Rosary as Source of Strength</h2><p>Saint Teresa of Calcutta drew her extraordinary strength for serving the poorest of the poor from her daily rosary devotion, which provided spiritual fuel for her demanding apostolate. Despite overwhelming need and suffering she encountered daily in Calcutta's slums, she maintained inner peace and joy through constant recourse to Mary's intercession. The rosary served as her spiritual anchor during the most challenging moments of her ministry, including the prolonged 'dark night of the soul' she experienced for decades.</p><h2>Practical Integration with Charitable Work</h2><p>Mother Teresa seamlessly integrated rosary prayer with her charitable activities, often praying while caring for dying patients, traveling between houses, or during brief rest periods. This integration demonstrated how contemplative prayer can enhance rather than compete with active apostolate. Her sisters learned to follow her example, finding that rosary prayer increased their compassion and patience while providing spiritual protection during emotionally and physically demanding work among society's most abandoned members.</p><h2>Teaching the Rosary to the Poor</h2><p>Beyond her personal devotion, Mother Teresa actively taught rosary prayer to the poor people she served, recognizing this simple prayer as accessible spiritual treasure that could transform their lives. She distributed rosary beads to patients, taught basic prayers to children, and encouraged families to pray together despite their material poverty. This evangelization through rosary demonstrated her conviction that spiritual poverty posed greater danger than material deprivation.</p><h2>The Rosary During Her 'Dark Night'</h2><p>During Mother Teresa's prolonged experience of spiritual darkness and apparent divine absence, the rosary provided reliable anchor that prevented despair and maintained her connection to God. Even when she felt no consolation in prayer, she continued faithful rosary recitation out of pure love and obedience. This perseverance during extreme spiritual trial demonstrated the rosary's value during the most difficult periods of spiritual life, when feelings and emotions provide no support for continued prayer.</p><h2>Global Impact Through Rosary Devotion</h2><p>Mother Teresa's public witness to rosary devotion inspired millions of Catholics worldwide to embrace this prayer as means of supporting missionary activities and charitable work. Her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech and numerous public appearances consistently emphasized prayer's importance, particularly the rosary, in addressing world's problems. This witness demonstrated how individual devotion can influence global consciousness and inspire others to deeper spiritual commitment.</p><h2>Legacy in the Missionaries of Charity</h2><p>The Missionaries of Charity continue Mother Teresa's tradition of combining intensive charitable work with faithful rosary devotion, showing how her spiritual practices remain relevant for contemporary religious life. New sisters learn that rosary prayer forms essential preparation for effective service to the poor, providing spiritual strength and motivation necessary for perseverance in difficult apostolate. This ongoing institutional commitment ensures that Mother Teresa's integration of contemplative prayer with active charity continues inspiring future generations of Catholic missionaries and charitable workers.</p></article>
