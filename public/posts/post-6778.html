    <article><h2>Introduction: Faith and Economic Justice</h2><p>Catholic teaching makes essential contributions to building just economic policies that serve human dignity and promote the common good. These contributions are not about promoting a particular economic system, but about ensuring that any economic system serves people rather than the other way around.</p><p>When Catholics bring these teachings to bear on economic policy, they help ensure that economic decisions respect human dignity, promote human flourishing, and serve the common good. This engagement is essential for building a more just and compassionate economic system.</p><h2>Key Catholic Principles for Economic Policy</h2><p>Several Catholic principles guide just economic policy. The dignity of work recognizes that all work has inherent value and that workers deserve just wages and safe working conditions. The universal destination of goods teaches that the earth's resources are meant for all people, not just some.</p><p>The preferential option for the poor calls for economic policies that give special attention to the needs of the most vulnerable. The principle of solidarity reminds us that we are all connected and that economic policies must show concern for the well-being of all people.</p><h2>Practical Applications in Policy</h2><p>These principles have several practical applications in economic policy. First, they call for policies that ensure all people have access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing. Second, they call for policies that promote just wages and working conditions for all workers.</p><p>Third, they call for policies that address economic inequality and provide economic opportunity for all people. Fourth, they call for policies that protect the environment and ensure sustainable development for future generations.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Moral Framework</h2><p>Catholic teaching provides an essential moral framework for building just economic policies. This framework helps ensure that economic policies serve human dignity and promote the common good.</p><p>When Catholics apply these teachings to economic policy, they help build a more just and compassionate economic system. They become instruments of God's love and justice in the world.</p><h2>Prayer for Just Economic Policies</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to apply Catholic teaching to building just economic policies. Give us the wisdom to work for policies that serve human dignity, the courage to stand up for the poor, and the charity to promote the common good. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
