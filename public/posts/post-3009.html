    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Canonization as Recognition of Holiness</h2><p>Canonization is the formal process by which the Catholic Church declares that a person is a saint and worthy of universal veneration. Catholic tradition sees this process as essential for ensuring that only truly holy individuals are recognized as saints. The canonization process is careful and thorough, involving extensive investigation of the person's life, writings, and reputation for holiness. This process ensures that the Church's saints are authentic models of Christian virtue and holiness.</p><h2>The Stages of the Canonization Process</h2><p>The canonization process involves several stages that carefully evaluate the person's holiness and the authenticity of any miracles attributed to their intercession. Catholic tradition sees this process as essential for maintaining the integrity of the Church's recognition of saints. The process begins with the declaration of a person as a Servant of God and progresses through the stages of Venerable, Blessed, and finally Saint. Each stage requires evidence of the person's holiness and, in later stages, miracles attributed to their intercession.</p><h2>The Role of Miracles in Canonization</h2><p>Miracles play an important role in the canonization process, providing evidence of the person's holiness and intercessory power. Catholic tradition sees miracles as signs that God is working through the person and that they are truly in heaven. The Church carefully investigates alleged miracles to ensure they are authentic and cannot be explained by natural causes. These miracles show that the person continues to intercede for others even after death.</p><h2>The Investigation of the Person's Life</h2><p>The canonization process includes a thorough investigation of the person's life, writings, and reputation for holiness. Catholic tradition sees this investigation as essential for ensuring that the person truly lived a holy life. The investigation examines the person's virtues, their relationship with God, and their service to others. This careful examination ensures that only truly holy individuals are recognized as saints.</p><h2>The Role of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints</h2><p>The Congregation for the Causes of Saints is responsible for overseeing the canonization process and ensuring its integrity. Catholic tradition sees this congregation as essential for maintaining the careful standards required for canonization. The congregation's work ensures that the process is thorough, fair, and based on solid evidence. This careful oversight helps maintain the Church's credibility in recognizing saints.</p><h2>Contemporary Applications</h2><p>Understanding the canonization process helps modern Catholics appreciate the careful standards the Church uses in recognizing saints. This understanding shows that canonization is not a casual or political process but a careful evaluation of holiness. The process provides Catholics with confidence that the Church's saints are authentic models of Christian virtue. This understanding also helps Catholics explain and defend the canonization process to others.</p><h2>Integration with Catholic Life</h2><p>The canonization process is integrated into the Church's life, providing a careful and reliable way to recognize authentic models of holiness. Catholic tradition emphasizes that the process should be thorough and based on solid evidence. This integration ensures that the Church's saints are truly worthy of veneration and imitation. The canonization process provides the Church with reliable models of holiness for the faithful.</p></article>
