    <article><h2>Matthew: The Tax Collector Turned Apostle</h2><p>Matthew, also known as Levi, is one of the most fascinating figures among the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, primarily because of his dramatic transformation from a despised tax collector to a devoted follower of Christ and author of the first Gospel. His story represents one of the most powerful examples of Jesus' ability to call and transform individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their past or social standing. Understanding who Matthew was as a tax collector helps us appreciate the radical nature of Jesus' ministry and the transformative power of His call.</p><p>Matthew's identity as a tax collector is significant because it places him in one of the most despised and marginalized groups in first-century Jewish society. Tax collectors were viewed as collaborators with the Roman occupation, traitors to their own people, and sinners who exploited their fellow Jews for personal gain. This background makes Matthew's calling and transformation all the more remarkable and demonstrates Jesus' willingness to reach out to those whom society had rejected.</p><p>Matthew's story also provides important insights into the nature of discipleship and the ways in which Jesus calls people from all backgrounds and circumstances to follow Him. His transformation from tax collector to apostle demonstrates that no one is beyond the reach of God's grace and that Jesus' ministry was intended for all people, regardless of their social status or past sins.</p><p>Understanding who Matthew was as a tax collector helps us appreciate the radical nature of Jesus' ministry and the transformative power of His call.</p><h2>Matthew's Identity and Background</h2><p>Matthew, also known as Levi, was a tax collector in Capernaum, a town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. His dual name reflects the cultural context of first-century Palestine, where many Jews had both Hebrew and Greek names. The name 'Matthew' means 'gift of God' in Hebrew, while 'Levi' connects him to the priestly tribe of Israel, though he was not serving as a priest.</p><p>As a tax collector, Matthew would have been employed by the Roman government or by local rulers who had been granted the right to collect taxes. Tax collectors in the Roman system were often local residents who were given the authority to collect various taxes from their own people, including customs duties, tolls, and other levies. This system was inherently corrupt, as tax collectors were expected to collect more than the required amount and keep the excess for themselves.</p><p>Matthew's position as a tax collector would have made him a wealthy man, as the system allowed for significant personal profit. However, this wealth came at a high social cost, as tax collectors were universally despised by their fellow Jews. They were considered traitors for collaborating with the Roman occupation and were often excluded from religious and social life.</p><p>Matthew's background as a tax collector also suggests that he was literate and had some education, as tax collection required the ability to read, write, and perform basic calculations. This education would later serve him well in his role as an apostle and author of the Gospel that bears his name.</p><h2>The Social Stigma of Tax Collectors</h2><p>In first-century Jewish society, tax collectors were among the most despised and marginalized groups. They were viewed as traitors to their own people, collaborators with the Roman occupation, and sinners who exploited their fellow Jews for personal gain. This social stigma had profound implications for Matthew's life and helps us understand the radical nature of Jesus' call to him.</p><p>Tax collectors were despised for several reasons. First, they were seen as collaborators with the Roman occupation, which was deeply resented by the Jewish people. The Romans were foreign conquerors who had imposed their rule on Israel, and anyone who worked for them was viewed as a traitor to the Jewish nation and religion.</p><p>Second, tax collectors were seen as sinners who exploited their own people for personal gain. The Roman tax system was inherently corrupt, allowing tax collectors to collect more than the required amount and keep the excess for themselves. This practice was seen as theft and exploitation of one's own people.</p><p>Third, tax collectors were often excluded from religious and social life. They were considered ritually unclean and were often barred from participating in synagogue services and other religious activities. They were also socially ostracized, with many people refusing to associate with them or even eat with them.</p><p>This social stigma makes Matthew's calling and transformation all the more remarkable. Jesus' willingness to call Matthew as a disciple demonstrates His radical approach to ministry and His willingness to reach out to those whom society had rejected.</p><h2>Matthew's Calling by Jesus</h2><p>The calling of Matthew by Jesus is recorded in all three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 9:9-13, Mark 2:13-17, Luke 5:27-32), though each account provides slightly different details. This calling represents one of the most dramatic moments in the New Testament and demonstrates Jesus' willingness to call people from all walks of life to follow Him.</p><p>According to the Gospel accounts, Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee when He saw Matthew sitting at his tax booth. Jesus simply said to him, 'Follow me,' and Matthew immediately got up and followed Him. This immediate response suggests that Matthew had been aware of Jesus' ministry and was ready to respond to His call.</p><p>The calling of Matthew is significant because it demonstrates Jesus' willingness to call people from all backgrounds and circumstances. Matthew was a tax collector, one of the most despised groups in Jewish society, yet Jesus called him to be one of His closest followers. This demonstrates that Jesus' ministry was intended for all people, regardless of their social status or past sins.</p><p>The calling of Matthew is also significant because it demonstrates the power of Jesus' call to transform lives. Matthew immediately left his lucrative position as a tax collector to follow Jesus, demonstrating the radical nature of discipleship and the willingness to make significant sacrifices for the sake of following Christ.</p><p>The calling of Matthew is also significant because it demonstrates Jesus' willingness to associate with sinners and outcasts. After calling Matthew, Jesus went to his house for a meal, where many tax collectors and sinners gathered. This association with sinners was deeply offensive to the religious leaders of the day, who criticized Jesus for eating with such people.</p><h2>Matthew's Response to Jesus' Call</h2><p>Matthew's response to Jesus' call is one of the most dramatic and immediate responses recorded in the New Testament. His willingness to leave everything behind and follow Jesus demonstrates the power of Jesus' call and the radical nature of discipleship.</p><p>Matthew's immediate response to Jesus' call suggests that he had been aware of Jesus' ministry and was ready to respond to His call. He may have been listening to Jesus' teachings or witnessing His miracles, and when Jesus called him, he was prepared to make the commitment to follow Him.</p><p>Matthew's response also demonstrates the radical nature of discipleship. He was willing to leave behind his lucrative position as a tax collector, his wealth, and his social status to follow Jesus. This willingness to make significant sacrifices demonstrates the power of Jesus' call and the importance of discipleship.</p><p>Matthew's response also demonstrates his faith and trust in Jesus. He was willing to leave behind everything he had known and trusted Jesus to provide for his needs and guide his future. This faith and trust demonstrate the depth of his commitment to Jesus and his willingness to follow Him wherever He led.</p><p>Matthew's response also demonstrates the transformative power of Jesus' call. He was immediately transformed from a despised tax collector to a follower of Jesus, demonstrating that Jesus' call has the power to change lives and transform individuals.</p><h2>Matthew's Role Among the Apostles</h2><p>As one of the twelve apostles, Matthew played an important role in Jesus' ministry and in the early Church. His background as a tax collector and his education would have made him a valuable member of the apostolic group.</p><p>Matthew's role among the apostles would have included participating in Jesus' ministry, witnessing His miracles, listening to His teachings, and learning from His example. As one of the twelve, he would have been present for many of the most important events in Jesus' ministry, including the Last Supper, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.</p><p>Matthew's background as a tax collector would have given him unique insights and perspectives that would have been valuable to the apostolic group. His experience with people from all walks of life, his understanding of the Roman system, and his ability to work with people who were often despised by society would have made him a valuable asset to Jesus' ministry.</p><p>Matthew's education and literacy would also have been valuable to the apostolic group. His ability to read, write, and perform calculations would have been useful in various aspects of Jesus' ministry, including record-keeping, communication, and the organization of the group.</p><p>Matthew's role among the apostles would also have included participating in the Great Commission after Jesus' resurrection.
