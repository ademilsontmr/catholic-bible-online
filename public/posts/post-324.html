    <p><em>2024-01-22</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Saint Joseph's courage was not the flashy bravery of a warrior, but the steady, determined courage of a man who would do anything to protect his family. His courage was rooted in love and faith.</p><h2>Courage in the Face of Danger</h2><p>When Herod sought to kill the infant Jesus, Joseph didn't hesitate. He immediately took action to protect his family, fleeing to Egypt in the middle of the night. This required tremendous courage - leaving everything familiar behind to protect those he loved.</p><h2>Courage in Daily Life</h2><p>Joseph's courage wasn't just for dramatic moments. He showed courage every day in providing for his family, in teaching Jesus his trade, and in guiding his family in faith. He had the courage to be a good father and husband.</p><h2>Courage Rooted in Faith</h2><p>Joseph's courage came from his faith in God. He knew that God had entrusted him with the care of the Holy Family, and this gave him the strength to face any challenge. His courage was not reckless, but wise and prayerful.</p><h2>Teaching Us Courage</h2><p>Saint Joseph teaches us that true courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act despite fear when it's the right thing to do. It's the courage to protect and care for those we love.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Saint Joseph, model of courage, help us to be brave in protecting and caring for our families. Give us the strength to face challenges with faith and love. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
