    <article><h2>Typology: Reading Scripture as a Unity</h2><p>Typology is a method of biblical interpretation that sees persons, events, and institutions in the Old Testament as foreshadowing or prefiguring realities in the New Testament. Catholic tradition sees typology as essential for understanding the unity of Scripture and God's plan of salvation. This approach helps Catholics see how the Old Testament prepares for and points toward Christ and the New Testament fulfillment. Typology shows that Scripture is not just a collection of books but a unified revelation of God's plan.</p><h2>Adam and Christ: The First and New Adam</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees Adam as a type of Christ, with Christ being the new Adam who reverses the effects of the first Adam's sin. This typology shows how Christ's obedience and sacrifice overcome the disobedience and sin of Adam. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the cosmic scope of Christ's redemptive work and shows how God's plan of salvation addresses the fundamental problem of human sin. This understanding helps Catholics see the unity of God's plan from creation to redemption.</p><h2>Moses and Christ: The Law and the Gospel</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees Moses as a type of Christ, with Christ being the new Moses who gives the new law and leads God's people to true freedom. This typology shows how Christ fulfills and perfects the work of Moses. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and shows how Christ brings the law to its fulfillment. This understanding helps Catholics see how the Old Testament law prepares for the Gospel.</p><h2>David and Christ: The King and the Kingdom</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees David as a type of Christ, with Christ being the new David who establishes the eternal kingdom of God. This typology shows how Christ fulfills the promises made to David and establishes a kingdom that will never end. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the royal dimension of Christ's mission and shows how He is the true king of Israel and of all creation. This understanding helps Catholics see Christ's kingship and the nature of His kingdom.</p><h2>Elijah and John the Baptist: The Prophetic Preparation</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees Elijah as a type of John the Baptist, with John being the new Elijah who prepares the way for Christ. This typology shows how the prophetic tradition prepares for the coming of the Messiah. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the continuity of God's prophetic work and shows how John fulfills the role of the forerunner. This understanding helps Catholics see the prophetic dimension of Christ's coming.</p><h2>The Passover and the Eucharist</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees the Passover as a type of the Eucharist, with the Eucharist being the new Passover that brings true liberation from sin and death. This typology shows how Christ's sacrifice fulfills and perfects the Passover sacrifice. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist and shows how it brings the liberation that the Passover prefigured. This understanding helps Catholics see the Eucharist as the fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrifices.</p><h2>The Temple and the Church</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees the Temple as a type of the Church, with the Church being the new Temple where God dwells among His people. This typology shows how the Church fulfills the role of the Temple as the place of God's presence and worship. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the Church's role as the dwelling place of God and shows how it continues the Temple's function in a new and perfect way. This understanding helps Catholics see the Church's sacred nature.</p><h2>The Exodus and Baptism</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees the Exodus as a type of baptism, with baptism being the new Exodus that brings liberation from sin and entry into the promised land of God's kingdom. This typology shows how baptism fulfills the liberation that the Exodus prefigured. Catholic theology emphasizes that this typology reveals the sacramental nature of baptism and shows how it brings the freedom that the Exodus promised. This understanding helps Catholics see baptism as the beginning of the Christian journey.</p><h2>Contemporary Applications</h2><p>Typology remains relevant for modern Catholics because it helps them understand the unity of Scripture and God's plan of salvation. This approach to biblical interpretation helps Catholics see how the Old Testament prepares for and points toward Christ. Typology also helps Catholics understand the sacraments, the Church, and the Christian life as fulfillments of Old Testament realities. This understanding enriches Catholic spirituality and worship.</p><h2>Liturgical and Devotional Use</h2><p>Typology is used extensively in Catholic liturgy, particularly in the Easter Vigil and other celebrations that show the connection between Old and New Testament readings. Catholic tradition sees typology as enriching the Church's worship and helping believers understand the depth of God's plan. The use of typology in liturgy shows how the Church reads Scripture as a unified whole and celebrates the fulfillment of God's promises in Christ.</p></article>
