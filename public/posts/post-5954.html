    <h1>Mary as Queen of the Rosary</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Mary's Royal Dignity and Queenship</h2><p>Mary's title as Queen of the Rosary flows from her broader queenship in the kingdom of God. As Mother of the King and perfect disciple, Mary holds unique position in God's kingdom that surpasses all other saints and angels. Her queenship involves not domination but loving service, as she uses her influence to guide souls to her Son and obtain graces needed for salvation and sanctification.</p><h2>The Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary</h2><p>The Church celebrates Mary's queenship over the rosary on October 7th, the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. This feast, established by Pope Pius V after the victory at Lepanto, honors Mary's powerful intercession through the rosary and her role as Queen who protects Christian civilization. The feast reminds believers that Mary's queenship involves active care for her subjects, particularly through the channel of rosary prayer.</p><h2>Mary's Kingdom of Hearts</h2><p>Mary exercises her queenship primarily in the realm of hearts, ruling through love rather than force. The rosary serves as primary means through which she extends her gentle reign, winning souls through beauty, truth, and maternal tenderness rather than compulsion. Those who pray the rosary regularly often report sensing Mary's queenly presence and experiencing her loving guidance in their spiritual lives.</p><h2>The Rosary as Royal Court</h2><p>In traditional imagery, the rosary represents Mary's royal court where she receives petitions from her subjects and grants favors according to her Son's will. Each decade represents approach to the Queen's throne, while the prayers serve as formal addresses befitting royal audience. This perspective elevates the rosary from simple devotion to privileged access to the Queen of Heaven's maternal care and intercession.</p><h2>Serving the Queen Through Devotion</h2><p>Recognizing Mary as Queen of the Rosary inspires greater reverence and fidelity in this devotion. Subjects naturally desire to please their queen through faithful service and devotion. Praying the rosary becomes act of loyalty to Mary's queenship while sharing in her mission of leading souls to Jesus. This royal perspective encourages consistency in prayer and attention to quality rather than mere quantity in rosary recitation.</p></article>
