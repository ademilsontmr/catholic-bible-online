    <p><em>2024-12-19</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: A Modern Evangelist</h2><p>Carlo Acutis has been called 'God's Influencer' because of his innovative use of modern technology to spread the Gospel and promote the Catholic faith. In a world where technology is often seen as a distraction from spiritual life, Carlo showed that it can be a powerful tool for evangelization and faith formation. His creative use of websites, digital presentations, and social media demonstrates that holiness and technology can work together to serve God's kingdom.</p><p>When Carlo created his website documenting Eucharistic miracles around the world, he was not just indulging in a hobby, but actively participating in the Church's mission of evangelization. He recognized that young people spend significant time online and that the digital space is a mission field that the Church cannot afford to ignore. Carlo's example shows that technology can be used to bring people closer to God rather than driving them away from Him.</p><h2>Innovative Use of Technology</h2><p>Carlo's innovative use of technology took many forms. He created a comprehensive website documenting Eucharistic miracles, complete with photographs, historical information, and spiritual reflections. He used his computer skills to create digital presentations about the faith that could be easily shared and understood by young people. He also used social media and other digital platforms to connect with peers and share his faith in ways that resonated with his generation.</p><p>What made Carlo's use of technology so effective was his understanding that technology is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. He used technology to serve his primary mission of bringing people closer to God and to the Eucharist. His digital work was always grounded in his deep faith and his desire to serve others. This approach made his evangelization both effective and authentic.</p><h2>The Impact of Digital Evangelization</h2><p>Carlo's digital evangelization has had a profound impact on the Church and on young people around the world. His website about Eucharistic miracles has been visited by millions of people and has helped to renew devotion to the Eucharist in many places. His example has inspired countless other young people to use their technological skills to serve God and to spread the Gospel.</p><p>This impact extends beyond the immediate results of his work. Carlo's example has helped the Church to recognize the importance of digital evangelization and to develop strategies for reaching young people in the digital spaces where they spend so much of their time. His work has also helped to break down the false dichotomy between technology and spirituality, showing that they can work together for God's glory.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Model for Digital Evangelization</h2><p>Carlo Acutis as 'God's Influencer' provides a powerful model for how technology can be used to serve God's kingdom. His example shows that holiness and technological skill are not mutually exclusive, but can work together to bring people closer to God. Carlo's work demonstrates that the digital age presents new opportunities for evangelization and that young people have unique gifts and skills that can serve the Church's mission.</p><p>As we prepare for Carlo's canonization, let us be inspired by his example to use our own gifts and talents, including our technological skills, to serve God and others. Let us recognize that every tool and talent we have can be used to spread the Gospel and to build up God's kingdom. Carlo's example shows that holiness is not about rejecting the modern world, but about using all the gifts God has given us to serve His purposes.</p><h2>Prayer for Digital Evangelization</h2><blockquote><p>'Saint Carlo Acutis, God's Influencer, pray for us that we may use our technological skills and other gifts to serve God and to spread the Gospel. Help us to be creative in our evangelization and to use all the tools available to us to bring people closer to Christ. In Jesus' name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
