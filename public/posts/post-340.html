<h2>Introduction: The Nativity of Mary</h2>
<p>The Church celebrates the birth of Mary as the dawn that precedes the Sun of Justice. In her, God prepares a humble dwelling for His Son.</p>
<h2>Meaning of the Feast</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grace in history:</strong> Mary’s birth announces salvation near at hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Joy and simplicity:</strong> God chooses the lowly to accomplish great things.</li>
  <li><strong>Family of faith:</strong> Mary’s life nurtures our filial trust in God.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scripture Echoes</h2>
<p>While Scripture is silent on her birth, <strong>Luke 1–2</strong> presents Mary as the faithful Daughter of Zion. Tradition preserves names of her parents, <em>Saints Joachim and Anne</em>, as models of hope.</p>
<h2>How to Celebrate</h2>
<p>Pray the Rosary; thank God for your baptismal calling; practice a small work of mercy in Mary’s honor.</p>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<blockquote><p>Heavenly Father, in Mary’s birth You gave the world hope. Form our hearts after hers, that we may welcome Your Son more perfectly. Amen.</p></blockquote>
