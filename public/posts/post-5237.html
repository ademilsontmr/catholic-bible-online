    <h1>The Blessing of Children (Psalm 127:3–5)</h1>
    <p><em>2025-01-27</em></p>
    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Children as Blessings</h2>
<p>The concept of children as blessings in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Psalm 127:3–5: "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate." This passage shows that children are not just a responsibility or a burden but are a precious gift from God that brings joy and blessing to married life.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that children are a blessing that strengthens the marriage bond and brings couples closer together. When couples welcome children into their marriage, they are not just adding to their family but are participating in God's creative work and fulfilling their vocation to be fruitful and multiply. This blessing is not about having perfect children but is about loving and raising children according to God's plan.</p>

<h2>Children as a Gift from God</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage are seen as a gift from God rather than a right or a possession. Just as God gave the gift of children to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, so too does He give the gift of children to married couples today. This gift is not something that couples can demand or control but is something that they receive with gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>When couples understand that children are a gift from God, they are better able to appreciate the blessing that children bring to their marriage. They are willing to make sacrifices for their children, to love them unconditionally, and to raise them according to God's plan. This understanding helps couples to see children not as a burden but as a blessing that enriches their marriage and their lives.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Parenting with Love</h2>
<p>Parenting children in Catholic marriage is practiced in the small, everyday moments of family life. This includes being patient with children's mistakes, being willing to teach and guide them, being willing to discipline them with love, being willing to spend time with them, and being willing to pray for them and with them. These daily practices of parenting with love build a strong foundation for the family.</p>

<p>This daily practice of parenting with love includes being willing to wake up early to care for children, being willing to stay up late to comfort them, being willing to sacrifice personal time to spend time with them, being willing to teach them about God and faith, and being willing to be a good example for them. When couples parent with love in these small ways, they are building a family that is strong and lasting.</p>

<h2>Children and Communication</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage are closely connected to communication between spouses. When couples are able to communicate effectively about parenting decisions, they are better able to work together to raise their children in a loving and consistent way. Good communication helps couples to be united in their approach to parenting and to support each other in the challenges of raising children.</p>

<p>This communication about children includes being willing to discuss important parenting decisions together, being willing to support each other in discipline and guidance, being willing to share the joys and challenges of parenting, being willing to work together to teach children about faith and values, and being willing to be united in their approach to raising children. When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are building a strong family.</p>

<h2>Children and Growth</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage are essential for personal and spiritual growth. When couples become parents, they are growing in virtues like patience, selflessness, and love. These virtues help them to become better people and better spouses. They also help them to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>

<p>This growth through parenting includes growing in patience as they learn to deal with children's needs and behaviors, growing in selflessness as they learn to put their children's needs before their own, growing in love as they learn to love their children unconditionally, growing in wisdom as they learn to guide and teach their children, and growing in holiness as they learn to raise their children according to God's plan. When couples grow in these virtues, they are not just improving their parenting but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

<h2>Children and the Mission of Marriage</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage are essential for fulfilling the mission of marriage. When couples have children, they are better able to serve God and others through their family. They are also better able to be witnesses to God's love and to the beauty of family life in the world.</p>

<p>This mission through children includes being willing to raise children in the faith, being willing to teach children about God's love, being willing to be witnesses to God's love through family life, being willing to serve others through their family, and being willing to build a family that reflects God's love. When couples fulfill this mission through their children, they are not just raising a family but are serving God and becoming better witnesses to His love.</p>

<h2>Children and Unity</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage help to strengthen the unity between spouses. When couples work together to raise their children, they are not just sharing a responsibility but are growing closer together in love and purpose. This unity is not about being perfect parents but is about working together to love and raise their children according to God's plan.</p>

<p>This unity through children includes being willing to work together to meet children's needs, being willing to support each other in parenting decisions, being willing to share the joys and challenges of parenting, being willing to be united in discipline and guidance, and being willing to grow together as parents. When couples work together in these ways, they are not just raising children but are strengthening their marriage and their family.</p>

<h2>The Grace of Parenting</h2>
<p>Parenting children in Catholic marriage is not something that couples can do on their own but requires God's grace. Through the sacrament of marriage, couples receive the grace they need to be good parents and to raise their children according to God's plan. This grace is not just given once at the wedding but is available throughout their married life.</p>

<p>Couples can access this grace through prayer, participation in the sacraments, and a commitment to living according to God's will. With God's help, any couple can be good parents and raise their children according to God's plan.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Precious Gift</h2>
<p>Children in Catholic marriage are a precious gift from God that helps couples to grow in holiness and to build a strong and lasting family. When couples welcome children into their marriage, they are not just adding to their family but are participating in God's creative work and fulfilling their vocation.</p>

<p>As we reflect on the blessing of children in marriage, let us remember that children are not just a responsibility but are a precious gift that requires God's grace. When we welcome children into our marriage, we are building a family that is based on love, blessing, and the grace of God.</p></article>
