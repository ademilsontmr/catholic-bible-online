Catholic tradition sees this title as essential for understanding both Mary's dignity and Christ's true nature.

This intercessory role shows that Mary is not just a model to imitate but an active helper in the spiritual life. Her prayers help believers grow in holiness and overcome difficulties.</p><h2>Mary's Role in Salvation History</h2><p>Mary plays a unique and essential role in God's plan of salvation.
