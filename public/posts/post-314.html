    <p><em>2024-01-24</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The marriage of Joseph and Mary stands as the most perfect example of what God intended marriage to be - a sacred covenant that reflects the love between Christ and His Church. Their relationship teaches us the true meaning of marital sanctity.</p><h2>Founded on God's Plan</h2><p>From the very beginning, Joseph and Mary's marriage was founded on God's plan, not human convenience or desire. When the angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, he revealed that Mary's pregnancy was the work of the Holy Spirit, part of God's divine plan for salvation. This teaches us that true marriage is always part of God's providential design.</p><h2>Complete Fidelity to God's Will</h2><p>The sanctity of their marriage was marked by complete fidelity to God's will. Both Joseph and Mary had made vows of virginity, dedicating themselves entirely to God's service. Yet they were truly married, their union blessed and sanctified by God Himself.</p><h2>Prayerful Approach to Difficulties</h2><p>Joseph's response to Mary's pregnancy reveals the depth of his understanding of marriage. When he discovered she was with child, he didn't react with anger or suspicion. Instead, he contemplated the situation prayerfully, seeking God's guidance. This prayerful approach to marital difficulties is essential for all couples.</p><h2>Mutual Trust and Respect</h2><p>The sanctity of their marriage was also evident in their mutual respect and love. Joseph protected Mary's dignity and reputation, while Mary trusted Joseph completely with her life and the life of her child. This mutual trust and respect is the foundation of any holy marriage.</p><h2>Openness to Life</h2><p>Their marriage was also characterized by complete openness to life. Though Mary's pregnancy was miraculous, Joseph and Mary were both open to God's plan for their family. They didn't plan their family according to their own desires, but according to God's will.</p><h2>Shared Mission</h2><p>Joseph and Mary's marriage was also marked by their shared mission. They were united not just in love for each other, but in their common mission to raise the Son of God. This shared mission gave their marriage a purpose beyond themselves, making it truly holy.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Saint Joseph and Blessed Virgin Mary, models of holy marriage, help all married couples to understand and live the true sanctity of marriage. May every marriage be a reflection of the love between Christ and His Church. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
