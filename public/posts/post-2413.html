This application helps Catholics become more faithful disciples of Christ and better witnesses to the Gospel.</p><h2>Building Unity Through Papal Teaching</h2><p>Catholic papal teaching should help Catholics understand how the Pope's teaching promotes unity in the Church. This includes recognizing that the Pope speaks for the universal Church and that his teaching helps maintain unity among Catholics around the world. Catholic papal teaching should help Catholics appreciate the gift of unity that comes from following the Holy Father's guidance. This unity helps Catholics work together to build the kingdom of God and serve others.</p><h2>Addressing Contemporary Issues</h2><p>Catholic papal teaching must address the contemporary issues that the Pope speaks about, including social justice, family life, environmental stewardship, and the challenges of modern life. This includes providing guidance on how to respond to these issues in ways that reflect Catholic teaching and the Pope's vision.
