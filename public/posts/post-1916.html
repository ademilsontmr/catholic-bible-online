    <article><h2>Why Do Catholics Baptize Infants?</h2><p>Catholics baptize infants because they believe that baptism is necessary for salvation and that children should not be deprived of this essential sacrament. The Catholic Church teaches that baptism removes original sin, makes us children of God, and incorporates us into the Church. Since infants are born with original sin and are in need of salvation, they should be baptized as soon as possible to receive the grace and benefits of this sacrament.</p><p>The practice of infant baptism has been part of the Christian tradition since the earliest days of the Church. The Bible shows that entire households were baptized, which would have included children and infants. The Church has consistently taught that baptism is for all people, regardless of age, and that parents have a responsibility to have their children baptized.</p><h2>The Biblical Foundation</h2><p>The biblical foundation for infant baptism is found in several passages of Scripture:</p><p><strong>Household Baptisms:</strong> In the New Testament, we see several examples of entire households being baptized. In Acts 16:15, we read that Lydia and her household were baptized. In Acts 16:33, the jailer and his household were baptized. In 1 Corinthians 1:16, St. Paul mentions baptizing the household of Stephanas. These household baptisms would have included children and infants.</p><p><strong>Jesus' Teaching on Children:</strong> Jesus showed special concern for children and taught that the Kingdom of God belongs to them. In Mark 10:14, Jesus says, 'Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.' This shows that children are not excluded from the benefits of God's grace.</p><p><strong>The Great Commission:</strong> In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands His disciples to 'make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit.' This command includes all people, including children and infants.</p><h2>The Necessity of Baptism</h2><p>The Catholic Church teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation. This teaching is based on Jesus' words in John 3:5: 'Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.'</p><p>Since baptism is necessary for salvation and infants are born with original sin, they should be baptized as soon as possible to receive the grace and benefits of this sacrament. To delay baptism would be to deprive children of the grace they need for salvation.</p><p>The Church also teaches that God desires the salvation of all people, including infants. Baptism is the ordinary means that God has established for salvation, and parents should not delay in having their children baptized.</p><h2>Original Sin and the Need for Baptism</h2><p>The Catholic Church teaches that all human beings are born with original sin, which is the sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve. Original sin is not a personal sin that we commit, but is a condition that we inherit from our first parents.</p><p>Original sin affects all human beings and makes us in need of salvation. Baptism removes original sin and makes us children of God. Since infants are born with original sin, they need baptism to be freed from this condition and to receive the grace of God.</p><p>The Church teaches that baptism is the ordinary means that God has established for the forgiveness of original sin and for incorporation into the Church. Parents have a responsibility to have their children baptized so that they can receive these benefits.</p><h2>The Grace of Baptism</h2><p>Baptism confers many graces and benefits, which are available to infants as well as adults:</p><p><strong>Removal of Original Sin:</strong> Baptism removes original sin and any personal sins that may have been committed.</p><p><strong>Adoption as Children of God:</strong> Baptism makes us children of God and members of His family.</p><p><strong>Incorporation into the Church:</strong> Baptism incorporates us into the Church, the Body of Christ.</p><p><strong>Reception of the Holy Spirit:</strong> Baptism gives us the Holy Spirit and makes us temples of the Holy Spirit.</p><p><strong>Eternal Life:</strong> Baptism gives us the promise of eternal life and makes us heirs of heaven.</p><h2>The Role of Parents and Godparents</h2><p>In infant baptism, the parents and godparents play an important role. They make promises on behalf of the child and commit to raising the child in the Catholic faith:</p><p><strong>Parents:</strong> Parents promise to raise their child in the Catholic faith, to teach them about God, and to help them grow in holiness. They commit to bringing their child to Mass, teaching them to pray, and helping them to live as disciples of Christ.</p><p><strong>Godparents:</strong> Godparents are chosen to help the parents in raising the child in the faith. They should be practicing Catholics who can serve as good examples and who can help the child grow in their relationship with God.</p><p><strong>Community:</strong> The entire parish community also has a role in supporting the parents and helping the child to grow in faith.</p><h2>Objections and Responses</h2><p>Some people object to infant baptism, claiming that it is not biblical or that children should wait until they are older to be baptized. Here are some common objections and responses:</p><p><strong>Objection: 'Infants cannot have faith, so they should not be baptized.'</strong> Response: Baptism is not based on our faith, but on God's grace. God gives the grace of baptism freely, and infants can receive this grace even though they cannot yet express faith.</p><p><strong>Objection: 'The Bible doesn't explicitly mention infant baptism.'</strong> Response: While the Bible doesn't explicitly mention infant baptism, it shows household baptisms which would have included children. The Bible also shows that children are not excluded from God's grace.</p><p><strong>Objection: 'Children should choose for themselves when they are older.'</strong> Response: Parents make many important decisions for their children, including decisions about their health, education, and well-being. Baptism is the most important gift that parents can give their children.</p><h2>The Early Church's Practice</h2><p>The practice of infant baptism has been part of the Christian tradition since the earliest days of the Church. The writings of the early Church Fathers show that infant baptism was practiced and defended:</p><p>St. Irenaeus, writing in the second century, speaks of 'infants and little children' being baptized. St. Hippolytus, writing in the third century, mentions the baptism of children. St. Augustine, writing in the fourth and fifth centuries, strongly defended the practice of infant baptism.</p><p>These early witnesses show that infant baptism was not a later development, but was the consistent practice of the Church from the beginning.</p><h2>Confirmation and First Communion</h2><p>In the Catholic Church, baptism is followed by confirmation and first communion. These sacraments complete the process of Christian initiation:</p><p><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Confirmation strengthens the grace received in baptism and gives the Holy Spirit more fully. In the Western Church, confirmation is usually received when the child is older, around the age of 12 or 13.</p><p><strong>First Communion:</strong> First communion is the first time a child receives the Eucharist. In the Western Church, children usually receive first communion around the age of 7 or 8, after they have been prepared through religious education.</p><p>These sacraments help children to grow in their faith and to participate more fully in the life of the Church.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Gift of Grace</h2><p>Infant baptism is a gift of God's grace that parents give to their children. It is not based on the child's faith or understanding, but on God's love and the parents' desire to give their child the best possible start in life.</p><p>Through baptism, infants receive the grace they need for salvation and are incorporated into the Church. They become children of God and receive the promise of eternal life. This is the greatest gift that parents can give their children.</p><p>Infant baptism is a beautiful expression of God's love for all people, regardless of age. It shows that God desires the salvation of all people and that He provides the means for salvation through the sacraments of the Church.</p></article>
