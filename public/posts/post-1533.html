    <article><h2>Introduction: Miracles and Natural Law</h2><p>Theological reflections on miracles and natural law represents a profound aspect of Catholic theology that recognizes the important relationship between miracles and the natural law that governs the created world.

The Catholic understanding of the theological relationship between miracles and natural law emphasizes that miracles do not contradict natural law but rather demonstrate God's power over creation, that natural law serves as the background against which miracles are recognized as extraordinary, and that both natural law and miracles serve God's purposes in creation and salvation. When we understand the theological relationship between miracles and natural law, we develop a deeper appreciation for both God's creation and His ongoing work in the world.</p><p>The Catholic approach to the theological relationship between miracles and natural law emphasizes that miracles do not contradict natural law but rather demonstrate God's power over creation, that natural law serves as the background against which miracles are recognized as extraordinary, and that both natural law and miracles serve God's purposes in creation and salvation.
