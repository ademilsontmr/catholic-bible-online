    <article><h2>Introduction: Divine Motherhood of Mary</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary as the Mother of God (Theotokos) emphasizes her unique divine motherhood that makes her the mother of Jesus Christ who is both fully human and fully divine while recognizing that Mary's motherhood extends to both the human and divine natures of Christ united in one divine person. The Church's understanding of Mary as Theotokos reflects the theological truth that Mary gave birth to the eternal Son of God who became incarnate for our salvation while maintaining her role as the first disciple and model of faith for all believers. Mary's divine motherhood demonstrates how God chose to work through human cooperation in the mystery of salvation while elevating human dignity through Mary's unique participation in the incarnation and redemption of humanity through her divine Son.</p><h2>The Council of Ephesus and Theological Foundation</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary as Theotokos was solemnly defined at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD which affirmed that Mary is truly the Mother of God because she gave birth to Jesus Christ who is one divine person with both human and divine natures while rejecting the Nestorian heresy that would have divided Christ into two separate persons. The Council's definition of Mary as Theotokos serves both to protect the doctrine of the Incarnation and to recognize Mary's unique dignity and role in salvation history through her divine motherhood. This theological foundation demonstrates how Mary's motherhood is inseparable from the mystery of Christ and reveals that honoring Mary as Mother of God is essential for understanding the truth about Jesus Christ and the mystery of salvation that God accomplished through the Incarnation of his eternal Son.</p><h2>Mary's Unique Dignity and Privileges</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on Mary as Mother of God emphasize her unique dignity and privileges that flow from her divine motherhood including her Immaculate Conception, perpetual virginity, and Assumption into heaven while recognizing that all of Mary's privileges serve her mission as Mother of God and Mother of the Church. The Church teaches that Mary's special graces and privileges are not ends in themselves but serve her unique role in salvation history as the one chosen by God to be the mother of the Savior. This understanding of Mary's dignity demonstrates how God prepared Mary for her unique vocation through special graces while showing that Mary's cooperation with God's plan serves as a model for all believers in responding to God's call with faith, obedience, and love for God and neighbor through participation in the mystery of salvation.</p><h2>Mary's Maternal Care and Intercession</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary as Mother of God includes attention to her maternal care and intercession for all believers while recognizing that Mary's spiritual motherhood extends to all members of the Church who are incorporated into the Body of Christ through baptism and faith. The Church teaches that Mary's maternal care flows from her divine motherhood and her role as Mother of the Church while her intercession serves to bring all people closer to her divine Son through prayer and spiritual guidance. This maternal dimension demonstrates how Mary continues her maternal mission in heaven through her intercession and protection while serving as a model of discipleship and faith for all believers who seek to follow Christ with the same dedication and love that Mary showed throughout her earthly life and continues to show in her heavenly glory.</p><h2>Mary's Role in Christian Devotion and Spiritual Life</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on Mary as Mother of God emphasize her central role in Christian devotion and spiritual life while promoting Marian devotions that serve both personal spiritual growth and deeper understanding of the mystery of Christ and salvation through Mary's maternal guidance and example. The Church encourages devotion to Mary as Mother of God through prayer, liturgical celebration, and personal devotion that serves both individual sanctification and community worship while recognizing that all Marian devotion ultimately leads to deeper union with Christ. This devotional dimension demonstrates how honoring Mary as Mother of God enriches Christian spiritual life while serving as a pathway to deeper faith and love for Christ through Mary's maternal intercession and example of perfect discipleship that shows all believers how to respond to God's grace with faith, hope, and love that leads to eternal life with God through participation in the divine life that Christ shares with all who believe in him through the Church that Mary serves as Mother and model of faith for all generations of believers who honor her as the blessed Mother of God and our spiritual mother who guides us to her divine Son.</p></article>
