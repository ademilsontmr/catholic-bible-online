This process shows that spiritual direction is about growing in relationship with God, not just solving problems.</p><h2>Alternative Forms of Spiritual Guidance</h2><p>While formal spiritual direction is valuable, there are other forms of spiritual guidance available. Catholic tradition sees this variety as essential for meeting different needs and circumstances. Alternative forms include spiritual reading, retreats, spiritual friendship, and regular confession.
