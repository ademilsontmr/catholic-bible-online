    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Trinity Sunday is not a puzzle to be solved but a mystery to be adored. God is communion: the Father gives all to the Son; the Son receives and returns all to the Father; the Spirit is the love poured out. The Christian life is participation in this exchange.</p><h2>Revelation of Communion</h2><p>At Jesus’ Baptism and Transfiguration we glimpse the Triune life. The Great Commission sends us to baptize “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” Salvation is entry into divine friendship.</p><h2>Praying Trinitarianly</h2><ul><li>Begin and end with the Sign of the Cross.</li><li>Address the Father through the Son in the Spirit.</li><li>Practice doxology: “Glory be to the Father...” throughout the day.</li></ul><h2>Imitation</h2><p>Families, parishes, and communities mirror God when they live unity with distinct gifts, mutual self-giving, and joy.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Most Holy Trinity, draw us into your life of love. Make us one, as you are One. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
