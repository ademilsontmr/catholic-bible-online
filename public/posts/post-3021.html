This principle shows that Catholic social teaching is about justice and compassion.</p><h2>Solidarity and the Common Good</h2><p>Solidarity and the common good are essential principles of Catholic social teaching that emphasize the interconnectedness of all people.

This understanding also helps Catholics explain and defend the Church's social mission to others.</p><h2>Integration with Catholic Life</h2><p>Catholic social teaching is integrated into every aspect of Catholic life, providing guidance and motivation for social action. Catholic tradition emphasizes that social teaching should inspire and guide the Church's mission and individual believers' actions. This integration ensures that Catholics work for justice and peace in their daily lives. Catholic social teaching provides the foundation and direction for the Church's social mission.</p></article>
