    <p><em>2024-12-19</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: The Role of Miracles</h2><p>Miracles play a crucial role in the canonization process, serving as divine confirmation of a person's holiness and their intercessory power with God. Carlo Acutis' path to sainthood has been marked by the recognition of miracles that demonstrate God's power working through his intercession. These miracles are not just extraordinary events, but signs of God's love and confirmation that Carlo is truly a saint in heaven.</p><p>When the Church recognizes miracles attributed to Carlo's intercession, it is not just acknowledging extraordinary events, but confirming that Carlo is in heaven and has the power to intercede for us before God. These miracles serve as proof that Carlo's life of holiness was authentic and that God continues to work through him to bring healing and grace to those who seek his intercession. The recognition of miracles is a crucial step in the canonization process and provides the faithful with confidence in Carlo's sanctity.</p><h2>The Nature of Carlo's Miracles</h2><p>The miracles attributed to Carlo Acutis' intercession have taken various forms, including physical healings, spiritual conversions, and other extraordinary graces. These miracles are carefully investigated by the Church through a rigorous process that includes medical examination, theological evaluation, and the testimony of witnesses. The Church's recognition of these miracles is not given lightly, but only after thorough investigation and confirmation that they cannot be explained by natural causes.</p><p>What makes Carlo's miracles particularly significant is that they often involve young people and families, reflecting his special concern for the young and his desire to help families grow in faith. These miracles demonstrate that Carlo's intercession is particularly powerful for those who are struggling with illness, family difficulties, or spiritual challenges. They also show that Carlo continues to care for the same people he cared for during his earthly life.</p><h2>The Canonization Process</h2><p>The canonization process requires the recognition of at least two miracles - one for beatification and one for canonization. These miracles must be thoroughly investigated and confirmed by the Church before the person can be declared a saint. The process involves medical experts, theologians, and Church officials who carefully examine the evidence and determine whether the miracles are authentic.</p><p>For Carlo Acutis, the recognition of miracles has been a crucial step in his journey to sainthood. These miracles provide the Church with the evidence it needs to declare Carlo a saint and to encourage the faithful to seek his intercession. They also serve as a powerful witness to Carlo's holiness and to the power of prayer and intercession.</p><h2>Conclusion: Signs of God's Power</h2><p>The miracles attributed to Carlo Acutis are not just extraordinary events, but signs of God's power and love working through his intercession. These miracles confirm Carlo's sanctity and provide the faithful with confidence in his intercessory power. They also serve as a powerful witness to the reality of heaven and to the communion of saints.</p><p>As we prepare for Carlo's canonization, let us give thanks for these miracles and for the confirmation they provide of Carlo's holiness. Let us also be inspired to seek Carlo's intercession in our own lives, trusting that God continues to work through him to bring healing and grace to those who call upon him. These miracles are a sign of hope and a reminder that God is always working in our lives, often through the intercession of His saints.</p><h2>Prayer for Miracles</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, we thank You for the miracles You have worked through Carlo's intercession. Help us to trust in his intercessory power and to seek his help in our times of need. May these miracles strengthen our faith and inspire us to pursue holiness in our own lives. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
