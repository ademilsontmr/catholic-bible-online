When American Catholics experience spiritual renewal authentically, they're not just going through religious motions or seeking spiritual experiences, but actively participating in God's work of renewing and revitalizing the Catholic Church in America, using their renewed faith to serve God and others more effectively, and to bear witness to Christ's love and truth in contemporary American society. This spiritual renewal is not about seeking personal spiritual experiences or about avoiding the challenges of life, but about finding the spiritual strength and guidance needed to deepen one's relationship with God and to serve others more effectively.</p><p>In today's United States, many American Catholics are experiencing various forms of spiritual renewal and deepening, from renewed interest in traditional Catholic practices and devotions to new forms of spiritual expression and community building that address various pastoral needs and concerns.
