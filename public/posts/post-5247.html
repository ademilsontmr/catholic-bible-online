    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Faith Working Through Love</h2>
<p>The concept of faith working through love in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Galatians 5:6: "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love." This passage shows that faith is not just a belief but is an active force that works through love. When couples allow their faith to work through love in their marriage, they are not just being religious but are actively participating in God's work of building up their relationship through acts of love.</p>
