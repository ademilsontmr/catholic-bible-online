Understanding the assessment of resources helps you recognize the importance of being realistic about what you can and cannot do in the journey of discipleship.</p><h2>The Cost of Peace</h2><p>The parable implies that making peace with the stronger king will require the weaker king to surrender and submit to the stronger king's terms.
