    <article><h2>Matthew: Apostle and Evangelist</h2><p>Matthew's role as an evangelist and his authorship of the Gospel that bears his name represents one of the most significant contributions to the New Testament and to the entire Christian tradition. As one of the twelve apostles who was also an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry, Matthew was uniquely qualified to write an authoritative account of Jesus' life, teachings, and ministry. His Gospel, which is the first book of the New Testament, has been one of the most influential and widely read books in Christian history, providing the foundation for understanding Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the nature of God's kingdom. Understanding Matthew's role as an evangelist and the composition of his Gospel helps us appreciate the careful and intentional way in which the early Church preserved and transmitted the story of Jesus.</p><p>Matthew's role as an evangelist is significant because he was both an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry and a trained observer who was able to record and organize the events of Jesus' life in a systematic and theological way. His background as a tax collector would have given him the education and organizational skills necessary to compose a comprehensive account of Jesus' ministry, while his experience as an apostle would have given him the spiritual insight and authority to interpret the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.</p><p>Matthew's Gospel is also significant because it was written primarily for a Jewish audience and emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. This focus makes Matthew's Gospel particularly important for understanding how the early Church understood Jesus' identity as the promised Messiah and how they interpreted His ministry in light of the Old Testament Scriptures.</p><p>Understanding Matthew's role as an evangelist and the composition of his Gospel helps us appreciate the careful and intentional way in which the early Church preserved and transmitted the story of Jesus.</p><h2>Matthew's Qualifications as an Evangelist</h2><p>Matthew was uniquely qualified to write an authoritative account of Jesus' life and ministry for several important reasons. His qualifications as an evangelist help us understand why his Gospel has been so influential and why it was accepted as authoritative by the early Church.</p><p>First, Matthew was an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry. As one of the twelve apostles, Matthew was present for many of the most important events in Jesus' ministry, including His teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. This eyewitness testimony gives Matthew's Gospel a level of authority and authenticity that would not be possible for someone who was not present during these events.</p><p>Second, Matthew was personally called by Jesus to be one of His disciples. This direct calling by Jesus gives Matthew a unique perspective on Jesus' ministry and a personal relationship with Jesus that would have informed his understanding and interpretation of Jesus' life and teachings.</p><p>Third, Matthew had the education and skills necessary to compose a written account of Jesus' ministry. His background as a tax collector would have required him to be literate and to have some education, including the ability to read, write, and perform basic calculations. These skills would have been essential for composing a written Gospel account.</p><p>Fourth, Matthew had the organizational skills necessary to compose a comprehensive and systematic account of Jesus' ministry. His work as a tax collector would have required him to be organized and systematic in his approach to record-keeping and documentation, skills that would have been valuable in composing a Gospel account.</p><h2>The Composition of the Gospel of Matthew</h2><p>The composition of the Gospel of Matthew involved a careful and intentional process of gathering, organizing, and presenting the material about Jesus' life and ministry. Understanding this process helps us appreciate the careful and thoughtful way in which Matthew composed his Gospel.</p><p>The composition of Matthew's Gospel likely involved several stages. First, Matthew would have gathered material from various sources, including his own memories of Jesus' ministry, the teachings and traditions that were passed down orally in the early Church, and possibly written sources that were available at the time.</p><p>Second, Matthew would have organized this material in a systematic and theological way. His Gospel is not simply a chronological account of Jesus' life, but a carefully organized presentation that emphasizes certain themes and theological perspectives, particularly Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the nature of God's kingdom.</p><p>Third, Matthew would have written his Gospel with a specific audience in mind. His Gospel was written primarily for a Jewish audience, and he emphasizes themes and perspectives that would have been particularly relevant and meaningful to Jewish readers, such as Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.</p><p>Fourth, Matthew would have composed his Gospel with the intention of providing an authoritative and reliable account of Jesus' life and ministry. His Gospel was intended to serve as a foundation for the faith and practice of the early Church, and he would have been careful to ensure that his account was accurate and reliable.</p><h2>The Structure and Organization of Matthew's Gospel</h2><p>Matthew's Gospel is carefully structured and organized to emphasize certain themes and theological perspectives. Understanding this structure helps us appreciate the intentional way in which Matthew composed his Gospel and the theological message he intended to convey.</p><p>Matthew's Gospel is organized around five major discourses or teaching sections, each of which is followed by a narrative section that describes Jesus' actions and miracles. This structure emphasizes the importance of Jesus' teachings and presents them in a systematic and organized way.</p><p>The five major discourses in Matthew's Gospel are: the Sermon on the Mount (chapters 5-7), the Missionary Discourse (chapter 10), the Parables of the Kingdom (chapter 13), the Community Discourse (chapter 18), and the Eschatological Discourse (chapters 24-25). Each of these discourses focuses on a particular aspect of Jesus' teaching and ministry.</p><p>Matthew's Gospel also includes a carefully crafted introduction and conclusion. The introduction (chapters 1-2) establishes Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, while the conclusion (chapters 26-28) focuses on Jesus' death, resurrection, and the Great Commission.</p><p>Matthew's Gospel also includes numerous references to Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus' life and ministry. These references are carefully placed throughout the Gospel to emphasize Jesus' identity as the promised Messiah and to demonstrate the continuity between the Old Testament and Jesus' ministry.</p><h2>The Theological Themes of Matthew's Gospel</h2><p>Matthew's Gospel emphasizes several important theological themes that reflect his understanding of Jesus' identity and mission. Understanding these themes helps us appreciate the theological message that Matthew intended to convey through his Gospel.</p><p>One of the most important theological themes in Matthew's Gospel is Jesus' identity as the Messiah. Matthew emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Him as the promised Messiah who has come to establish God's kingdom. This theme is developed throughout the Gospel through numerous references to Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment.</p><p>Another important theological theme in Matthew's Gospel is the nature of God's kingdom. Matthew presents Jesus as the one who has come to establish God's kingdom on earth, and he emphasizes the ethical and moral dimensions of this kingdom. The Sermon on the Mount, in particular, presents a comprehensive vision of what life in God's kingdom should look like.</p><p>Another important theological theme in Matthew's Gospel is the universal scope of Jesus' ministry. While Matthew's Gospel was written primarily for a Jewish audience, it also emphasizes that Jesus' message is intended for all people, including Gentiles. This theme is developed through various stories and teachings that emphasize the inclusion of Gentiles in God's kingdom.</p><p>Another important theological theme in Matthew's Gospel is the importance of discipleship and following Jesus. Matthew emphasizes the radical nature of discipleship and the willingness to make significant sacrifices for the sake of following Jesus. This theme is developed through various teachings and stories about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.</p><h2>The Historical Context of Matthew's Gospel</h2><p>Understanding the historical context in which Matthew's Gospel was written helps us appreciate the challenges and opportunities that Matthew faced in composing his Gospel and the ways in which he addressed the needs and concerns of his audience.</p><p>Matthew's Gospel was likely written in the latter part of the first century, probably between 70 and 90 AD. This was a period of significant change and challenge for the early Church, as it was transitioning from a primarily Jewish movement to a more universal movement that included Gentiles.</p><p>One of the most significant historical events that would have influenced the composition of Matthew's Gospel was the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD. This event would have raised important questions about the future of Judaism and the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and Matthew's Gospel addresses these questions by emphasizing the continuity between the Old Testament and Jesus' ministry.</p><p>Another important historical factor that would have influenced the composition of Matthew's Gospel was the growing tension between the early Church and the Jewish religious establishment. As the Church grew and developed, it faced increasing opposition from Jewish religious leaders, and Matthew's Gospel addresses this tension by emphasizing Jesus' authority and the legitimacy of His ministry.</p><p>Another important historical factor that would have influenced the composition of Matthew's Gospel was the need to provide a reliable and authoritative account of Jesus' life and ministry for the growing Christian community. As the Church expanded and as the first generation of eyewitnesses began to pass away, there was an increasing need for written accounts of Jesus' life and ministry.</p><h2>The Impact and Influence of Matthew's Gospel</h2><p>Matthew's Gospel has had a profound impact and influence on the Christian tradition and continues to be one of the most important and widely read books in the New Testament.
