    <p><em>2025-01-27</em></p>
    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Avoiding Harsh Words</h2>
<p>Avoiding harsh words in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Proverbs 15:1: "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." This passage shows that the words we use have a powerful impact on our relationships, either for good or for harm. When couples avoid harsh words in their marriage, they are not just being polite but are actively choosing to use words that build up rather than tear down their relationship.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that avoiding harsh words is not just about being nice but is about actively choosing to use words that promote peace and harmony. When couples avoid harsh words, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ. This avoidance is not about being perfect but is about being willing to choose words that build up rather than tear down.</p>

<h2>Harsh Words as a Source of Conflict</h2>
<p>Harsh words in Catholic marriage serve as a major source of conflict and division. Just as harsh words can stir up anger and create division in any relationship, so too can they damage the love and unity in marriage. This harshness is not just about being direct but is about using words that are hurtful, critical, or demeaning.</p>

<p>When couples avoid harsh words in their marriage, they are not just being polite but are actively protecting their relationship from conflict and division. They are able to communicate in ways that promote peace and harmony, to resolve conflicts without escalating them, to build each other up rather than tear each other down, to create an environment where love can flourish, and to maintain unity and harmony in their relationship. This avoidance becomes a powerful protection for their marriage.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Avoiding Harsh Words</h2>
<p>Avoiding harsh words is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes choosing words that build up rather than tear down, speaking gently and kindly to each other, avoiding criticism and sarcasm, resolving conflicts peacefully, and creating an environment where love can flourish. These daily practices of avoiding harsh words build a strong foundation for the relationship.</p>

<p>This daily practice includes being willing to choose words that build up one's spouse rather than tear them down, being willing to speak gently and kindly to one's spouse even when disagreeing, being willing to avoid criticism and sarcasm that can be hurtful, being willing to resolve conflicts peacefully without escalating them, and being willing to create an environment where love and harmony can flourish. When couples practice avoiding harsh words in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and peaceful.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Harsh Words and Communication</h2>
<p>Avoiding harsh words is closely connected to communication. When couples are able to communicate without using harsh words, they are better able to build trust and to resolve conflicts effectively. Good communication helps couples to express their thoughts and feelings in ways that promote peace and harmony.</p>

<p>This communication for avoiding harsh words includes being willing to express concerns and disagreements in a gentle and respectful way, being willing to listen to one's spouse's concerns without becoming defensive, being willing to choose words that promote understanding rather than conflict, being willing to resolve disagreements peacefully, and being willing to create an environment where communication can be loving and respectful. When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are building a relationship based on peace and harmony.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Harsh Words and Growth</h2>
<p>Avoiding harsh words is essential for personal and spiritual growth. When couples avoid harsh words, they are growing in virtues like kindness, patience, and love. These virtues help them to become better people and better spouses. They also help them to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>

<p>This growth through avoiding harsh words includes growing in kindness as they learn to be kind in their words and actions, growing in patience as they learn to be patient when communicating, growing in love as they learn to love each other more tenderly, growing in self-control as they learn to control their words, and growing in holiness as they learn to use words that reflect Christ's love. When couples grow in these virtues, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Peaceful Love</h2>
<p>Avoiding harsh words in Catholic marriage is a peaceful love that helps couples to grow in holiness and to build a strong and lasting relationship. When couples avoid harsh words, they are not just being polite but are actively choosing to use words that build up rather than tear down their relationship.</p>

<p>As we reflect on avoiding harsh words, let us remember that this avoidance is not just a human effort but is a divine wisdom that requires God's grace. When we avoid harsh words, we are building a marriage that is based on peace, harmony, and the grace of God.</p></article>
