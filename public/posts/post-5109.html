    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Obedience to Christ's Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is a fundamental aspect of Catholic understanding of this sacrament. Matthew 28:19 provides the biblical foundation for this understanding: 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.' This verse shows that baptism is not just a human tradition or ecclesiastical practice, but a direct command from Jesus Christ Himself.</p><p>The Catholic Church has always understood baptism as an act of obedience to Christ's command. When we baptize, we are not just following a tradition or performing a ritual, but obeying the direct command of our Lord and Savior. This obedience is not optional but is essential for the Church's mission and for the salvation of souls. Through baptism, we fulfill Christ's command to make disciples and to bring all people into the life of the Church.</p><h2>The Context of Matthew 28:19</h2><p>To understand baptism as obedience to Christ's command, we must examine the context of Matthew 28:19. This verse is part of the Great Commission, Jesus' final instructions to His disciples before His ascension into heaven. These words are among the last that Jesus spoke to His apostles and carry the weight of His final command.</p><p>The full context reads: 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.' This shows that baptism is part of a larger mission to make disciples and to teach them to obey Christ's commands.</p><p>This context shows that baptism is not an isolated act but part of the Church's mission to proclaim the Gospel and make disciples of all nations.</p><h2>The Authority of Christ's Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is based on the authority of Jesus Christ. The verse begins with Jesus saying: 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.' This shows that Jesus has the authority to command His disciples to baptize and that this command carries divine authority.</p><p>This authority means that baptism is not just a human practice but a divine command that must be obeyed. When the Church baptizes, it is acting under the authority of Christ and fulfilling His command. This authority also means that baptism is not optional but is essential for the Church's mission.</p><p>The authority of Christ's command also shows that baptism is not just a cultural practice or human tradition, but a divine institution that carries the weight of Christ's authority.</p><h2>The Mission to Make Disciples</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is connected to the mission to make disciples. The verse says: 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations.' This shows that baptism is part of the process of making disciples and bringing people into the Christian community.</p><p>This mission is not optional but is essential for the Church's identity and purpose. The Church exists to make disciples and to bring all people to Christ. Baptism is the means through which this mission is accomplished and people are incorporated into the community of disciples.</p><p>This mission also shows that baptism is not just about individual salvation but about building up the community of believers and expanding the kingdom of God on earth.</p><h2>The Universal Scope of the Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command has a universal scope. The verse says: 'make disciples of all nations.' This shows that baptism is not limited to a particular people or culture but is intended for all people everywhere.</p><p>This universal scope shows that baptism is part of God's plan to save all people and to bring them into the life of the Church. The command to baptize is not limited by race, culture, or social status, but applies to all people who come to faith in Christ.</p><p>This universal scope also shows that the Church's mission is not limited to a particular group but extends to all people throughout the world.</p><h2>The Trinitarian Formula</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command includes the use of the Trinitarian formula. The verse says: 'baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.' This shows that baptism must be performed using these specific words and in the name of all three Persons of the Trinity.</p><p>This Trinitarian formula is not optional but is essential for valid baptism. The Catholic Church has always used this formula and has never accepted baptism performed with different words as valid. This formula shows that baptism is connected to the revelation of the Trinity and to our relationship with all three Persons of the Godhead.</p><p>This formula also shows that baptism is not just a human ritual but a divine action that involves all three Persons of the Trinity.</p><h2>The Teaching Mission</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is connected to the teaching mission of the Church. The verse says: 'teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.' This shows that baptism is not the end of the process but the beginning of a lifelong journey of learning and obedience.</p><p>This teaching mission shows that baptism is not just about individual salvation but about forming disciples who will live according to Christ's teachings. The Church is called not just to baptize people but to teach them to live as faithful disciples of Christ.</p><p>This teaching mission also shows that baptism is part of a larger process of Christian formation and discipleship.</p><h2>The Apostolic Succession</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is connected to the apostolic succession. The command was given to the apostles, and through them, it has been passed down to the bishops and priests of the Church. This succession ensures that the command continues to be fulfilled throughout history.</p><p>This apostolic succession shows that baptism is not just a human practice but is connected to the authority that Christ gave to His apostles. When the Church baptizes, it is acting under the authority that Christ gave to His apostles and that has been passed down through the generations.</p><p>This succession also ensures that baptism is performed with the proper authority and in the proper way.</p><h2>The Ongoing Nature of the Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command is ongoing and continues throughout history. The command was not just for the apostles but for all generations of the Church. The Church continues to baptize today in obedience to this command.</p><p>This ongoing nature shows that the command is not limited to a particular time or place but continues to be relevant and necessary today. The Church's mission to baptize and make disciples continues until the end of time.</p><p>This ongoing nature also shows that baptism is not just a historical practice but a living reality that continues to transform lives today.</p><h2>The Personal Response to the Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command involves a personal response from each believer. When we are baptized, we are not just following a tradition but responding to Christ's command to be baptized. This response involves faith and obedience to Christ's will.</p><p>This personal response shows that baptism is not just a passive act but involves active participation and cooperation with Christ's command. We are called to respond to Christ's invitation to be baptized and to live as His disciples.</p><p>This response also shows that baptism is not just about the Church's mission but about our personal relationship with Christ and our obedience to His will.</p><h2>Conclusion: Fulfilling Christ's Command</h2><p>Baptism as obedience to Christ's command reveals that this sacrament is not just a human practice but a divine command that must be obeyed. Through baptism, we fulfill Christ's command to make disciples and to bring all people into the life of the Church.</p><p>As we reflect on Matthew 28:19 and our obedience to Christ's command, let us be grateful for the privilege of participating in this mission and recommit ourselves to living as faithful disciples. May we always remember that through baptism, we are obeying Christ's command and participating in His mission to save the world.</p><h2>Prayer for Obedience to Christ's Command</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, thank You for the command to baptize and make disciples. Help us to understand the privilege and responsibility of obeying Your command and to fulfill our mission with faithfulness and love. May we always remember that through baptism, we are obeying Your command and participating in Your mission to save the world. Give us the grace to be faithful witnesses to Your love and to invite others to share in the life of the Church through baptism. In Your name we pray, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
