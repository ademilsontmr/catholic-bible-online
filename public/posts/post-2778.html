    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>What is Environmental Stewardship?</h2><p>Environmental stewardship in the Catholic tradition is the responsible care and management of God's creation. It is based on the understanding that the earth and all its resources are gifts from God, entrusted to humanity for our use and care. Catholic environmental stewardship is not just about protecting the environment, but about recognizing our role as stewards of God's creation and fulfilling our responsibility to care for the earth and all living things.</p><p>This stewardship is grounded in the biblical understanding that God created the world and declared it good, and that humanity has been given the responsibility to 'till and keep' the garden of creation (Genesis 2:15). Catholic environmental stewardship recognizes that we are part of creation, not separate from it, and that our well-being is intimately connected to the health of the environment.</p><h2>The Biblical Foundation</h2><p>The foundation of Catholic environmental stewardship is found in Scripture, particularly in the creation accounts in Genesis. The Bible teaches us that God created the world and all living things, and that He declared His creation to be good. God then entrusted the care of creation to humanity, giving us the responsibility to be good stewards of the earth and its resources.</p><p>Throughout the Bible, we see God's care for creation and His concern for the well-being of all living things. The Psalms frequently speak of God's love for His creation, and the prophets often spoke about the importance of caring for the land and living in harmony with nature. Jesus Himself often used images from nature in His teachings, showing His appreciation for the beauty and wonder of God's creation.</p><h2>Creation as God's Gift</h2><p>Catholic environmental stewardship begins with the recognition that creation is a gift from God. The earth and all its resources are not our property to use as we please, but gifts entrusted to us for our care and responsible use. This understanding calls us to gratitude for God's gifts and to a sense of responsibility for their care.</p><p>This gift of creation is meant to be shared with all people, including future generations. Catholic environmental stewardship recognizes that we have a responsibility to ensure that the earth's resources are available for the well-being of all people, both now and in the future. This includes working to address environmental problems that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable.</p><h2>The Common Good and Environmental Justice</h2><p>Catholic environmental stewardship is closely connected to the principle of the common good, which calls us to work for the well-being of all people and of the entire human family. Environmental problems often affect the poor and vulnerable more than others, and Catholic social teaching calls us to address these injustices.</p><p>Environmental justice involves ensuring that all people have access to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. It also involves working to address the root causes of environmental problems, such as poverty, inequality, and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production.</p><h2>Pope Francis and Laudato Si'</h2><p>Pope Francis' encyclical 'Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home' has been a landmark document in Catholic environmental teaching. In this encyclical, Pope Francis calls for an 'integral ecology' that recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental, social, economic, and spiritual issues.</p><p>Pope Francis emphasizes that environmental problems are not just technical issues, but moral and spiritual issues that require a change of heart and a new way of living. He calls for a 'conversion' that involves changing our relationship with creation and recognizing our responsibility to care for the earth and all living things.</p><h2>Practical Steps for Environmental Stewardship</h2><p>Catholic environmental stewardship involves both individual and collective action. On the individual level, we can make choices that reduce our environmental impact, such as conserving energy and water, reducing waste, and choosing sustainable products. We can also educate ourselves about environmental issues and support policies and practices that promote environmental protection.</p><p>On the collective level, Catholic environmental stewardship involves working with others to address environmental problems and to promote sustainable development. This might include supporting environmental organizations, participating in community environmental projects, or advocating for policies that protect the environment and promote the common good.</p><h2>Education and Formation</h2><p>Education and formation are important aspects of Catholic environmental stewardship. The Church has a responsibility to educate people about environmental issues and to help them understand their responsibility to care for creation. This education should include both scientific understanding of environmental problems and moral and spiritual reflection on our relationship with creation.</p><p>Catholic schools, parishes, and other institutions can play an important role in environmental education and formation. They can provide opportunities for people to learn about environmental issues, to reflect on their relationship with creation, and to take action to care for the environment.</p><h2>Prayer and Spirituality</h2><p>Prayer and spirituality are also important aspects of Catholic environmental stewardship. Prayer helps us to recognize God's presence in creation and to develop a deeper appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the natural world. It also helps us to recognize our responsibility to care for creation and to ask for God's help in fulfilling this responsibility.</p><p>Many Catholic prayers and liturgical celebrations include references to creation and our responsibility to care for it. The celebration of the Eucharist, for example, includes prayers of thanksgiving for the gifts of creation, and many saints have written prayers and reflections on the beauty and wonder of God's creation.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Call to Action</h2><p>Catholic environmental stewardship is a call to action that involves recognizing our responsibility to care for God's creation and working to address environmental problems. It is not just about protecting the environment, but about living in harmony with creation and working for the common good of all people and of the entire human family.</p><p>As we reflect on our responsibility for environmental stewardship, let us remember that we are called to be good stewards of God's creation and to work for the well-being of all people and of the earth itself. May our efforts to care for creation be a witness to God's love and a source of hope for a more just and sustainable world.</p></article>
