    <p><em>2024-12-19</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: When Laws Are Unjust</h2><p>Catholics have a duty to resist unjust laws when those laws violate fundamental moral principles or human dignity. This duty flows from our recognition that human law must be in conformity with divine law and natural law, and that we cannot obey laws that require us to do what is morally wrong.</p><p>This resistance is not about being disobedient or rebellious, but about being faithful to God and to the truth. Throughout history, saints and martyrs have demonstrated that sometimes the most faithful response to unjust laws is peaceful, non-violent resistance.</p><h2>What Makes a Law Unjust</h2><p>A law is unjust when it violates fundamental moral principles or human dignity. Examples of unjust laws include laws that legalize abortion, euthanasia, or same-sex marriage, as these laws violate the sanctity of human life and the natural order of marriage.</p><p>Other examples include laws that discriminate against people based on race, religion, or other characteristics, laws that violate religious freedom, and laws that promote or enable injustice and oppression. When laws are unjust, Catholics have a moral obligation to resist them.</p><h2>How to Resist Unjust Laws</h2><p>There are several ways to resist unjust laws. First, Catholics can work to change unjust laws through the democratic process, advocating for better policies and supporting candidates who promote justice. Second, they can engage in peaceful, non-violent civil disobedience when necessary, following the example of figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and St. Thomas More.</p><p>Third, they can refuse to cooperate with unjust laws when possible, finding ways to serve the common good without violating their conscience. Fourth, they can educate others about why certain laws are unjust and what alternatives exist.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Sacred Duty</h2><p>Resisting unjust laws is a sacred duty that flows from our commitment to truth and justice. This duty is not about being disobedient, but about being faithful to God and to the dignity of every human person.</p><p>When Catholics resist unjust laws with wisdom and charity, they become powerful witnesses to the truth and instruments of God's love and justice in the world. They help build a society that respects human dignity and promotes the common good.</p><h2>Prayer for Resisting Injustice</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to resist unjust laws with wisdom and charity. Give us the courage to stand up for what is right, the wisdom to recognize injustice, and the charity to work for justice for all people. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
