    <article><h2>Who was St. Augustine?</h2><p>Saint Augustine of Hippo (354-430) was one of the most important theologians and spiritual writers in the history of the Catholic Church. Born in North Africa, Augustine lived a tumultuous early life before his dramatic conversion to Christianity at the age of 32.
