    <p><em>2024-12-20</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Mary as Mother and Guide</h2><p>Holiness through total consecration to Mary is about recognizing that Mary is not just a historical figure or a distant saint, but our spiritual mother who loves us with a mother's love and who wants to help us grow in holiness and become more like her Son, Jesus Christ. Total consecration to Mary is not about worshiping her or replacing Jesus, but about entrusting ourselves completely to her maternal care and allowing her to guide us on the path to holiness. When we consecrate ourselves to Mary, we're not just saying prayers or making promises, but entering into a deep, personal relationship with her and allowing her to work in our lives.</p><p>Total consecration to Mary is based on the understanding that Mary is the perfect disciple of Christ and that she can help us to become better disciples as well. She shows us how to say 'yes' to God's will, how to trust in His plan even when it's difficult, and how to love and serve others with humility and generosity. When we consecrate ourselves to Mary, we're not just asking for her help, but committing ourselves to following her example and allowing her to form us more and more into the image of her Son.</p><h2>What Total Consecration Means</h2><p>Total consecration to Mary involves several important aspects. First, it means entrusting ourselves completely to her maternal care, recognizing that she loves us and wants what's best for us. Second, it means allowing her to guide us in our spiritual life, asking for her intercession and following her example. Third, it means imitating her virtues, especially her humility, her trust in God, and her love for others. Fourth, it means praying to her regularly and developing a personal relationship with her. Fifth, it means allowing her to help us grow closer to Jesus and to become more like Him.</p><h2>Conclusion: Mary as Path to Jesus</h2><p>Total consecration to Mary leads to holiness because it helps us to grow closer to Jesus and to become more like Him. When we consecrate ourselves to Mary, we're not just developing a devotion to her, but allowing her to guide us on the path to holiness and to help us become better disciples of Christ. This consecration transforms our spiritual life and helps us to experience the love and care of our spiritual mother. Mary becomes not just a distant figure, but a loving mother who guides us to her Son and helps us to grow in holiness.</p><h2>Prayer for Total Consecration</h2><blockquote><p>'Blessed Virgin Mary, help us to consecrate ourselves totally to You and to entrust ourselves to Your maternal care. Guide us on the path to holiness and help us to become more like Your Son, Jesus Christ. May our consecration to You lead us to greater union with Him and help us to grow in holiness. In Jesus' name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
