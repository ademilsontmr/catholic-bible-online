    <article><h2>Introduction: Baptism and Faith</h2><p>What is the connection between baptism and the profession of faith? This question addresses one of the most important aspects of the sacrament of baptism. Romans 10:9-10 provides the biblical foundation for this understanding: 'Because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.' These verses reveal the essential connection between faith and salvation, and how this faith is professed and lived through baptism.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that baptism is the sacrament of faith that requires both the profession of faith and the gift of faith. Through baptism, we profess our faith in Christ and receive the grace to live according to that faith. This profession is not just a one-time declaration but is a lifelong commitment to believe in Christ and to live as His disciples.</p><h2>The Context of Romans 10:9-10</h2><p>To understand the connection between baptism and the profession of faith, we must examine the context of Romans 10:9-10.

For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.'</p><p>These verses show that salvation requires both belief in the heart and confession with the lips.
