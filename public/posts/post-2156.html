    <article><h2>Praying for the Church</h2><p>The Church is the Body of Christ, and praying for the Church is praying for Christ Himself. When we pray for the Church, we are praying for all the baptized, for the clergy, for religious, and for the Church's mission in the world.</p><p>Jesus prayed for the Church before His death: 'I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours' (John 17:9). We should follow His example.</p><h2>Praying for the Pope and Bishops</h2><p>The Pope and bishops are the successors of the apostles, and they carry a heavy responsibility for the Church. Pray for them daily - for wisdom, strength, courage, and holiness. Pray that they will be faithful to their calling and lead the Church with love and truth.</p><h2>Praying for Priests and Religious</h2><p>Priests and religious need our prayers. They have given their lives to serve God and His people, and they face many challenges and temptations. Pray for their holiness, their ministry, and their perseverance.</p><h2>Praying for the Faithful</h2><p>Pray for all the baptized - that they will grow in faith, hope, and love. Pray for those who are struggling, those who have fallen away, and those who are seeking God.</p><h2>Praying for the Church's Mission</h2><p>Pray for the Church's mission of evangelization - that the Gospel will be preached to all nations. Pray for missionaries, catechists, and all those who work to spread the faith.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Praying for the Church is a privilege and a responsibility. Let us be faithful in this important ministry of intercessory prayer.</p></article>
