    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Mental Health Ministry</h2><p>Mental health ministry is deeply rooted in Scripture and Catholic teaching about the whole person and God's care for our emotional and psychological well-being. The Bible is filled with stories of people who experienced mental and emotional challenges, from David's psalms of depression to Job's struggle with suffering. Jesus Himself showed compassion to those who were suffering emotionally and psychologically, healing not just physical ailments but also emotional wounds. The Bible teaches us that God cares for our whole person - body, mind, and soul - and that spiritual care is an important part of overall health.
