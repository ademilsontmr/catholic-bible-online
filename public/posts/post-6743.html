    <article><h2>Introduction: Religious Freedom as Fundamental Right</h2><p>Religious freedom is a fundamental human right that must be defended through political engagement. This freedom is not just about the right to worship, but about the right to live one's faith in all aspects of life, including the public square. When religious freedom is threatened, all human rights are at risk.</p><p>Politics as a way of defending religious freedom means working for laws and policies that protect this fundamental right for all people, regardless of their religious beliefs. It means recognizing that religious freedom is not a privilege granted by the state, but a right that comes from God and must be respected by all.</p><h2>What Religious Freedom Includes</h2><p>Religious freedom includes several elements. First, it includes the freedom to worship according to one's conscience. Second, it includes the freedom to live one's faith in daily life, including in the workplace, schools, and public spaces.</p><p>Third, it includes the freedom to bring one's faith to bear on political questions and to advocate for policies that reflect one's religious values. Fourth, it includes the freedom to educate one's children according to one's religious beliefs.</p><h2>Defending Religious Freedom Through Politics</h2><p>Defending religious freedom through politics means several things. First, it means working for laws that protect religious freedom and prevent discrimination based on religion. Second, it means speaking out against policies that would restrict religious freedom or force people to act against their religious beliefs.</p><p>Third, it means working with people of different faiths to protect religious freedom for all. Fourth, it means educating others about the importance of religious freedom and how it benefits society as a whole.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Sacred Responsibility</h2><p>Defending religious freedom through politics is a sacred responsibility that flows from our recognition that religious freedom is a fundamental human right. This responsibility is not just about protecting our own religious freedom, but about protecting religious freedom for all people.</p><p>When Catholics engage in politics to defend religious freedom, they become instruments of God's love and justice in the world. They help build a society that respects the dignity and worth of every human person, including their right to live according to their religious beliefs.</p><h2>Prayer for Religious Freedom</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to defend religious freedom through our political engagement. Give us the wisdom to work for laws that protect this fundamental right, and the courage to speak out against policies that would restrict it. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
