Living virtuously involves developing good habits and making choices that align with God's plan for human flourishing. This path shows that holiness is not just for saints but for all Christians.</p><h2>The Theological Virtues</h2><p>The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity are the foundation of the Christian life.
