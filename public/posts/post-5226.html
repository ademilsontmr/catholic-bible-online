    <h1>A Threefold Cord Is Not Quickly Broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12)</h1>
    <p><em>2025-01-27</em></p>
    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of the Threefold Cord</h2>
<p>The concept of the threefold cord in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Ecclesiastes 4:12: "And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken." This passage shows that when God is present in a marriage, the relationship becomes stronger and more resilient. The threefold cord represents the husband, the wife, and God working together to create a bond that cannot be easily broken.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that the strength of a marriage does not come from the couple alone but from their relationship with God. When couples invite God into their marriage, they are not just adding a third person to the relationship but are creating a sacred bond that is protected and strengthened by God's grace. This threefold cord becomes a source of strength and stability in times of difficulty.</p>

<h2>God as the Third Strand</h2>
<p>In the threefold cord of marriage, God serves as the third strand that binds the husband and wife together. Just as a rope with three strands is stronger than a rope with only two strands, so too is a marriage stronger when God is present. This divine presence is not just a nice addition but is essential for the strength and stability of the relationship.</p>

<p>When God is present in a marriage, He provides the grace that couples need to love each other, to communicate effectively, to resolve conflicts, and to fulfill their vocation. This grace is not just given once at the wedding but is available throughout their married life. When couples rely on this grace, they are able to build a marriage that is strong and lasting.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of the Threefold Cord</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes praying together as a couple, participating in the sacraments together, reading Scripture together, and making decisions together in prayer. These daily practices help couples to keep God at the center of their relationship and to rely on His strength and guidance.</p>

<p>This daily practice of the threefold cord includes being willing to seek God's guidance in important decisions, being willing to pray for each other's needs, being willing to attend Mass together, being willing to participate in the sacrament of reconciliation together, and being willing to grow in faith together. When couples practice the threefold cord in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and lasting.</p>

<h2>The Threefold Cord and Communication</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage is closely connected to communication. When couples are able to communicate effectively with each other and with God, they are better able to understand each other's needs and to work together to meet those needs. Good communication helps couples to keep God at the center of their relationship and to rely on His guidance and strength.</p>

<p>Communication in the threefold cord includes being willing to pray together about important decisions, being willing to share one's spiritual journey with one's spouse, being willing to discuss how God is working in one's life, and being willing to seek God's guidance together. When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are strengthening their threefold cord.</p>

<h2>The Threefold Cord and Unity</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage creates a unity that is stronger than the sum of its parts. When husband, wife, and God work together, they create a bond that is unbreakable. This unity is not just about being together but is about working together for a common purpose and goal.</p>

<p>This unity through the threefold cord includes being united in faith, being united in prayer, being united in service to God and others, and being united in the mission of marriage. When couples are united in these ways, they are not just living together but are working together to build a strong and lasting marriage.</p>

<h2>The Threefold Cord and Strength</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage provides strength and stability in times of difficulty. When couples face challenges, they are not alone but have God's strength and guidance to help them through. This strength is not just about being able to endure difficulties but is about being able to grow and learn from them.</p>

<p>This strength through the threefold cord includes being able to face financial difficulties together, being able to face health problems together, being able to face family problems together, and being able to face spiritual difficulties together. When couples rely on the threefold cord, they are able to face any challenge with confidence and hope.</p>

<h2>The Threefold Cord and Witness</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage is a powerful witness to the world of God's love and strength. When couples live their marriage with God at the center, they show the world what a strong and lasting marriage looks like. This witness is particularly important in a world that often values temporary relationships over lasting commitments.</p>

<p>This witness through the threefold cord includes showing the world that marriage is not just a human institution but is a divine institution that is protected and strengthened by God. When couples live their marriage with God at the center, they become a sign of hope and inspiration to others.</p>

<h2>The Grace of the Threefold Cord</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in marriage is not something that couples can create on their own but requires God's grace. Through the sacrament of marriage, couples receive the grace they need to keep God at the center of their relationship and to rely on His strength and guidance. This grace is not just given once at the wedding but is available throughout their married life.</p>

<p>Couples can access this grace through prayer, participation in the sacraments, and a commitment to living according to God's will. With God's help, any couple can create a threefold cord that is strong and lasting.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: An Unbreakable Bond</h2>
<p>The threefold cord in Catholic marriage is an unbreakable bond that helps couples to grow in holiness and to build a strong and lasting relationship. When couples keep God at the center of their marriage, they create a bond that is protected and strengthened by God's grace.</p>

<p>As we reflect on the threefold cord in marriage, let us remember that this bond is not just a human creation but is a divine gift that requires God's grace. When we keep God at the center of our marriage, we are building a relationship that is strong, lasting, and filled with God's love.</p></article>
