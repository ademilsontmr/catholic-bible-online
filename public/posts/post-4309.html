    <article><h2>Matthew's Jewish Orientation and Purpose</h2><p>The Gospel of Matthew is widely recognized as the Gospel that was written primarily for a Jewish audience, containing numerous features and characteristics that would have been particularly meaningful and relevant to Jewish readers. Understanding why Matthew is considered the Gospel for the Jewish audience helps us appreciate the distinctive nature of his presentation of Jesus and the ways in which he sought to demonstrate to his Jewish readers that Jesus was indeed the fulfillment of their messianic hopes and expectations. This understanding also provides important insights into how the early Church sought to bridge the gap between Judaism and Christianity and to demonstrate the continuity between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p><p>Matthew's Jewish orientation is significant because it demonstrates the early Church's concern to reach Jewish people with the gospel and to demonstrate that Jesus was the fulfillment of their religious hopes and expectations. This concern reflects the fact that the early Church was initially composed primarily of Jewish believers and that there was a need to demonstrate the continuity between Judaism and Christianity.</p><p>Matthew's Jewish orientation is also significant because it provides important insights into how the early Church understood the relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Matthew's emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies demonstrates that the early Church saw Jesus as the culmination of God's work throughout the history of Israel.</p><p>Understanding why Matthew is considered the Gospel for the Jewish audience helps us appreciate the distinctive nature of his presentation of Jesus and the ways in which he sought to demonstrate to his Jewish readers that Jesus was indeed the fulfillment of their messianic hopes and expectations.</p><h2>Matthew's Use of Jewish Terminology</h2><p>One of the most distinctive features of Matthew's Gospel is his use of Jewish terminology and concepts that would have been familiar and meaningful to Jewish readers. This use of Jewish terminology reflects Matthew's concern to communicate effectively with his Jewish audience and to present Jesus in terms that they would understand and appreciate.</p><p>Matthew's use of the phrase 'Kingdom of Heaven' instead of 'Kingdom of God' is particularly significant. While the other Gospels use 'Kingdom of God,' Matthew consistently uses 'Kingdom of Heaven,' which was more acceptable to Jewish readers who avoided using the name of God directly. This usage reflects Matthew's sensitivity to Jewish religious practices and his desire to communicate in a way that would be respectful to Jewish sensibilities.</p><p>Matthew's use of Jewish religious concepts and practices is also significant. He frequently refers to Jewish customs, practices, and religious concepts that would have been familiar to his Jewish audience, such as the Sabbath, the temple, the law, and various Jewish religious practices. These references help to establish the Jewish context of Jesus' ministry and to demonstrate His connection to Jewish religious life.</p><p>Matthew's use of Jewish names and titles is also significant. He frequently uses Jewish names and titles for Jesus, such as 'Son of David,' 'King of the Jews,' and 'Messiah,' which would have been meaningful to Jewish readers and would have helped them to understand Jesus' identity and mission.</p><p>Matthew's use of Jewish geographical and historical references is also significant. He frequently refers to Jewish geographical locations and historical events that would have been familiar to his Jewish audience, helping to establish the Jewish context of Jesus' ministry and to demonstrate His connection to Jewish history and tradition.</p><h2>Matthew's Emphasis on Old Testament Fulfillment</h2><p>One of the most distinctive features of Matthew's Gospel is his emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and promises. This emphasis is particularly important for Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with the Old Testament and would have been looking for the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.</p><p>Matthew includes numerous explicit fulfillment formulas, such as 'This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet,' followed by a quotation from the Old Testament. These formulas appear throughout the Gospel and emphasize the intentional nature of Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. This emphasis would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these prophecies and would have been looking for their fulfillment.</p><p>Matthew's emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of messianic prophecies is particularly significant. He demonstrates that Jesus fulfills the various messianic expectations found in the Old Testament, such as being born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), being a descendant of David (2 Samuel 7:12-13), and being the suffering servant (Isaiah 53). This emphasis would have been particularly important to Jewish readers, who would have been looking for the fulfillment of these messianic expectations.</p><p>Matthew's emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of the law and the prophets is also significant. He presents Jesus as the one who fulfills the law and the prophets, not by abolishing them but by bringing them to their intended fulfillment. This emphasis would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been concerned about the relationship between Jesus and the law.</p><p>Matthew's emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of God's promises to Israel is also significant. He demonstrates that Jesus is the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, David, and the people of Israel, and that through Jesus, God's purposes for Israel are being accomplished. This emphasis would have been particularly important to Jewish readers, who would have been looking for the fulfillment of these promises.</p><h2>Matthew's Presentation of Jesus as the New Moses</h2><p>One of the most distinctive features of Matthew's Gospel is his presentation of Jesus as the new Moses. This presentation would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with Moses as the great lawgiver and deliverer of Israel.</p><p>Matthew structures his Gospel around five major discourses, similar to the five books of Moses (the Pentateuch). This structure emphasizes the parallel between Jesus and Moses and presents Jesus as the one who gives the new law and establishes the new covenant. This structure would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with the five books of Moses and would have understood the significance of this parallel.</p><p>Matthew's presentation of Jesus as a teacher and lawgiver is also significant. He presents Jesus as the one who teaches with authority and who gives the new law that fulfills and transcends the old law. This presentation would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with Moses as the great teacher and lawgiver of Israel.</p><p>Matthew's presentation of Jesus as the deliverer of God's people is also significant. He presents Jesus as the one who delivers God's people from bondage and leads them into freedom, just as Moses delivered the Israelites from Egypt. This presentation would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with the story of the exodus and would have understood the significance of this parallel.</p><p>Matthew's presentation of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity is also significant. He presents Jesus as the one who brings God's presence to His people and who makes it possible for people to have a relationship with God, just as Moses mediated between God and the Israelites. This presentation would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with Moses' role as mediator.</p><h2>Matthew's Genealogy and Jewish Heritage</h2><p>Matthew's genealogy of Jesus is particularly significant for Jewish readers, as it establishes Jesus' connection to the most important figures in Jewish history and demonstrates His fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.</p><p>Matthew's genealogy begins with Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, and traces Jesus' ancestry through David, the great king of Israel. This genealogy establishes Jesus' connection to the two most important figures in Jewish history and demonstrates that He fulfills the promises made to both Abraham and David. This connection would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these figures and the promises made to them.</p><p>Matthew's genealogy is structured in three groups of fourteen generations, from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile, and from the Babylonian exile to Jesus. This structure emphasizes the significance of David and the Babylonian exile in Jewish history and demonstrates that Jesus is the culmination of God's work throughout the history of Israel. This structure would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these historical periods and their significance.</p><p>Matthew's genealogy includes several women who were Gentiles or who had questionable backgrounds, such as Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba. This inclusion emphasizes the universal scope of Jesus' mission and demonstrates that God's plan of salvation includes all people, regardless of their background or social status. This inclusion would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these women and their stories.</p><p>Matthew's genealogy concludes with Joseph, the husband of Mary, emphasizing that Jesus was legally Joseph's son and therefore a descendant of David. This legal connection to David establishes Jesus' right to the throne of Israel and His identity as the promised Messiah. This connection would have been particularly important to Jewish readers, who would have been concerned about Jesus' credentials as the Messiah.</p><h2>Matthew's Emphasis on Jewish Religious Practices</h2><p>Matthew's Gospel includes numerous references to Jewish religious practices and customs that would have been familiar and meaningful to Jewish readers. These references help to establish the Jewish context of Jesus' ministry and to demonstrate His connection to Jewish religious life.</p><p>Matthew's references to the Sabbath and Jewish religious practices are significant.

These references would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these practices and would have been concerned about Jesus' relationship to them.</p><p>Matthew's references to the temple and Jewish worship are also significant. He includes numerous references to the temple and Jewish worship practices, demonstrating Jesus' connection to Jewish religious life and His respect for Jewish religious institutions. These references would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with the temple and its significance in Jewish religious life.</p><p>Matthew's references to the law and Jewish legal practices are also significant. He includes numerous references to the law and Jewish legal practices, demonstrating Jesus' connection to Jewish religious life and His understanding of the law. These references would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with the law and its significance in Jewish religious life.</p><p>Matthew's references to Jewish religious leaders and their practices are also significant. He includes numerous references to Jewish religious leaders, such as the Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes, and their practices, demonstrating Jesus' interactions with Jewish religious life and His critique of certain aspects of it. These references would have been particularly meaningful to Jewish readers, who would have been familiar with these leaders and their practices.</p><h2>Contemporary Application</h2><p>Understanding why Matthew is considered the Gospel for the Jewish audience continues to be relevant for contemporary Christians and provides important insights and principles that can guide our understanding of the Gospel and our approach to sharing it with others.
