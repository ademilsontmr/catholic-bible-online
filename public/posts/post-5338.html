    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Trusting God in Conflict</h2>
<p>Trusting God in times of conflict in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Psalm 46:1: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." This passage shows that trusting God in times of conflict is not just a nice concept but is a divine reality where God is our refuge and strength. When couples understand trusting God in times of conflict, they are not just being hopeful but are actively turning to God as their refuge and strength during difficult times in their marriage.</p>

This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to trust God.</p>
