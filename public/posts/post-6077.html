    <h1>Catholic Social Teaching on Economic Justice</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Economic Justice as Moral Imperative</h2><p>Catholic social teaching on economic justice provides comprehensive framework for evaluating economic systems and policies according to their service to human dignity, common good, and authentic development while establishing moral principles that transcend particular economic theories or partisan political positions. This teaching emphasizes that economic activity must serve human welfare rather than treating persons as mere factors of production while building systems that enable all people to participate meaningfully in economic life through productive work and fair compensation. Economic justice serves both individual dignity and social solidarity while reflecting divine purposes for creation and human community.</p><h2>Understanding Human Dignity in Economic Life</h2><p>Catholic teaching emphasizes that economic justice requires recognition of human dignity that transcends market value or economic productivity while ensuring that economic systems serve authentic human development rather than reducing persons to mere economic units or disposable resources. This dignity-based approach means that economic policies must be evaluated according to their impact on human welfare and community solidarity rather than merely efficiency or profit maximization that ignores essential requirements of human nature and social responsibility. Economic justice protects human dignity while enabling authentic freedom and genuine opportunity for advancement through merit and effort.</p><h2>Right to Work and Living Wages</h2><p>Catholic social teaching emphasizes fundamental right to work that includes both access to employment opportunities and compensation sufficient for supporting worker and family with dignity while enabling participation in cultural and social life that reflects complete human development. This right includes governmental responsibility to promote full employment through economic policies while ensuring that wages enable authentic family life rather than requiring multiple jobs or government assistance for basic necessities. Living wage advocacy serves economic justice while strengthening family structures and community stability that benefit entire society rather than merely individual workers.</p><h2>Property Rights and Social Responsibility</h2><p>Catholic teaching supports private property rights as important for human dignity and authentic freedom while emphasizing that property ownership carries social responsibilities including stewardship of resources for community benefit and obligation to ensure that property use serves rather than harms common good. This balanced approach prevents both collectivist elimination of private property and individualistic absolutization of property rights that ignores social obligations and community welfare. Property rights serve economic justice when properly ordered toward authentic human development and social solidarity rather than mere accumulation or exploitation of others' labor and resources.</p><h2>Market Economy and Governmental Regulation</h2><p>Catholic social teaching supports market economy as effective mechanism for resource allocation and innovation while requiring governmental regulation that ensures market activity serves authentic human welfare and prevents exploitation, fraud, and environmental degradation that harm individual dignity and community welfare. This approach recognizes both benefits and limitations of market mechanisms while supporting policies that harness market efficiency for authentic human development rather than allowing market forces to determine all social relationships and values. Regulated markets serve economic justice while maintaining space for competition and innovation that benefit society.</p><h2>Conclusion: Comprehensive Economic Reform</h2><p>Catholic social teaching on economic justice provides framework for comprehensive economic reform that serves human dignity while building systems that enable authentic development and social solidarity rather than merely maximizing economic growth or individual wealth accumulation that ignores community welfare and moral requirements. This framework enables evaluation of contemporary economic challenges including inequality, unemployment, environmental degradation, and global poverty while providing guidance for policies that serve authentic human welfare according to divine purposes for economic life. Catholic engagement in economic policy should reflect this comprehensive understanding while building coalitions with others who share commitment to justice and human dignity.</p><h2>Prayer for Economic Justice</h2><p>Creator God, we pray for economic justice that serves human dignity and enables all people to participate meaningfully in economic life through fair wages and meaningful work. Help us to build economic systems that serve authentic human development while protecting the environment and promoting community solidarity. Grant wisdom to economic and political leaders that they may create policies that serve the common good while respecting legitimate property rights and market freedom according to your divine plan for human flourishing. Amen.</p></article>
