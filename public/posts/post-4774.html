    <article><h2>Building Self-Worth through God's Love</h2><p>Many people struggle with low self-worth, feeling inadequate, unworthy, or not good enough. These feelings can prevent us from pursuing our dreams, taking risks, and experiencing the fullness of life that God has planned for us. However, Psalm 139:14 provides powerful encouragement: 'I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.' This verse provides the foundation for understanding how to build self-worth through God's love. Understanding how to build self-worth through God's love helps you recognize that you are valuable and loved by God.</p><h2>The Biblical Foundation: Psalm 139:14</h2><p>Psalm 139:14 provides the foundation for building self-worth through God's love: 'I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.'

Understanding this biblical foundation helps you recognize that your worth comes from God's love and creation, not from external factors.</p><h2>Understanding the Source of Self-Worth</h2><p>True self-worth comes from understanding that you are loved and valued by God, not from external achievements, approval from others, or meeting certain standards.
