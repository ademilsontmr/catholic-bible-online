    <article><h2>Praying as a Couple: Strengthening Your Marriage Through Prayer</h2><p>Praying together as a couple is one of the most powerful ways to strengthen your marriage and deepen your relationship with God and each other. When couples pray together, they invite God into their relationship, creating a sacred bond that goes beyond the physical and emotional aspects of marriage. Prayer helps couples grow in unity, communicate more effectively, and face life's challenges together with faith and hope.</p><p>Praying as a couple doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. Even simple prayers said together can have a profound impact on your relationship.
