    <article><h2>The Parable of the Ten Minas – Luke 19:11–27</h2><p>Jesus' parable of the ten minas, found in Luke 19:11-27, provides profound insights into faithful stewardship and using God's gifts for his kingdom. This parable reveals that God gives each person gifts and abilities, and that he expects us to use them faithfully for his purposes. Understanding the parable of the ten minas helps you recognize your responsibility to use God's gifts wisely and the consequences of failing to do so. This parable serves as both a challenge to be faithful stewards and a warning about the consequences of unfaithfulness.</p><h2>The Nobleman and His Journey</h2><p>The parable begins with a nobleman who goes to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then return. This nobleman represents Jesus Christ, who went to heaven to receive his kingdom and will return to establish it fully. Understanding the nobleman and his journey helps you recognize that Jesus is the king who will return and establish his kingdom.</p><h2>The Distribution of Minas</h2><p>The parable describes how the nobleman calls ten of his servants and gives them ten minas, telling them to put the money to work until he comes back. These minas represent the gifts, abilities, and opportunities that God gives to each person. Understanding the distribution of minas helps you recognize that God has given you gifts and abilities to use for his kingdom.</p><h2>The Faithful Servants</h2><p>The parable describes how some servants are faithful and use their minas to earn more. One servant earns ten more minas, and another earns five more. These faithful servants represent those who use their gifts and abilities faithfully for God's kingdom. Understanding the faithful servants helps you recognize the importance of using your gifts faithfully for God's purposes.</p><h2>The Master's Approval</h2><p>The parable describes how the master commends the faithful servants and gives them authority over cities in proportion to their faithfulness.

Understanding the unfaithful servant helps you recognize the danger of not using your gifts for God's purposes.</p><h2>The Master's Disapproval</h2><p>The parable describes how the master is angry with the unfaithful servant and takes his mina away from him, giving it to the servant who had ten minas.

Understanding the master's disapproval helps you recognize the consequences of not using your gifts for God's kingdom.</p><h2>Lessons About Faithful Stewardship</h2><p>The parable teaches that we should be faithful stewards of the gifts and abilities that God has given us. We should use them actively for his kingdom rather than hiding them away. Understanding these lessons helps you recognize your responsibility to use your gifts faithfully for God's purposes.</p><h2>Lessons About God's Gifts</h2><p>The parable emphasizes that God gives gifts and abilities to each person and expects them to be used for his kingdom.
