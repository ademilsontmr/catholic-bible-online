    <article><h2>Jesus' Surprising Choice of Matthew</h2><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew, a tax collector, as one of His twelve apostles represents one of the most surprising and counter-cultural decisions in the New Testament. In a society where tax collectors were universally despised as traitors and sinners, Jesus' decision to call Matthew to be one of His closest followers demonstrates the radical nature of His ministry and His willingness to challenge social conventions. Understanding why Jesus chose Matthew helps us appreciate the depth of Jesus' mission to reach all people and the ways in which He deliberately chose individuals who would challenge the status quo and demonstrate the inclusive nature of God's kingdom.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew is significant because it demonstrates His willingness to call people from all walks of life, regardless of their social status or past sins. Matthew's background as a tax collector would have made him one of the most despised and marginalized individuals in Jewish society, yet Jesus chose him to be one of His closest followers. This choice demonstrates that Jesus' ministry was intended for all people, not just those who were socially acceptable or religiously pure.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew is also significant because it demonstrates His willingness to challenge social conventions and religious expectations. The religious leaders of the day would have been deeply offended by Jesus' association with tax collectors and sinners, yet Jesus deliberately chose Matthew and even ate with him and his friends. This choice demonstrates Jesus' willingness to challenge the religious and social norms of His day.</p><p>Understanding why Jesus chose Matthew helps us appreciate the depth of Jesus' mission to reach all people and the ways in which He deliberately chose individuals who would challenge the status quo and demonstrate the inclusive nature of God's kingdom.</p><h2>Demonstrating God's Grace and Mercy</h2><p>One of the primary reasons Jesus chose Matthew was to demonstrate God's grace and mercy toward sinners. Matthew's background as a tax collector made him a perfect example of someone who was considered beyond the reach of God's grace, yet Jesus' choice of him demonstrates that no one is beyond God's love and forgiveness.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew demonstrates that God's grace is available to all people, regardless of their past sins or social standing. Matthew's work as a tax collector would have involved significant sin and exploitation of his fellow Jews, yet Jesus chose him to be one of His closest followers. This choice demonstrates that God's grace is not limited to those who are socially acceptable or religiously pure.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's mercy extends to those who are most in need of it. Tax collectors were among the most despised and marginalized groups in Jewish society, yet Jesus chose Matthew to demonstrate that God's mercy is available even to those who are considered the worst sinners.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's forgiveness is complete and transformative. Matthew's calling and subsequent transformation demonstrate that God's forgiveness not only removes the guilt of sin but also transforms the sinner into a new person who is capable of serving God and others.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's grace is not earned but is freely given. Matthew had done nothing to deserve Jesus' call, yet Jesus chose him anyway. This choice demonstrates that God's grace is a gift that is freely given to those who are willing to receive it.</p><h2>Challenging Social and Religious Conventions</h2><p>Another important reason Jesus chose Matthew was to challenge the social and religious conventions of His day. By choosing a tax collector as one of His disciples, Jesus was deliberately challenging the religious and social norms that excluded certain people from God's kingdom.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew challenged the religious leaders' understanding of who was acceptable to God. The Pharisees and other religious leaders believed that God only accepted those who were ritually pure and who followed the law strictly. By choosing Matthew, Jesus demonstrated that God's acceptance is not based on ritual purity or strict adherence to the law, but on faith and repentance.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also challenged the social hierarchy of the day. In first-century Jewish society, tax collectors were at the bottom of the social ladder, despised and excluded from religious and social life. By choosing Matthew, Jesus demonstrated that God's kingdom is not based on social status or wealth, but on faith and commitment to God.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also challenged the religious leaders' understanding of holiness and separation. The Pharisees believed that holiness required separation from sinners and outcasts, yet Jesus deliberately associated with tax collectors and sinners. By choosing Matthew, Jesus demonstrated that true holiness involves reaching out to sinners and bringing them into God's kingdom.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also challenged the religious leaders' understanding of God's character. The Pharisees believed that God was primarily concerned with judgment and punishment, yet Jesus' choice of Matthew demonstrates that God is primarily concerned with mercy and restoration.</p><h2>Demonstrating the Inclusive Nature of God's Kingdom</h2><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew was also intended to demonstrate the inclusive nature of God's kingdom. By choosing a tax collector as one of His disciples, Jesus was showing that God's kingdom is open to all people, regardless of their background, social status, or past sins.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew demonstrates that God's kingdom is not limited to the religious elite or the socially acceptable. Matthew's background as a tax collector would have made him completely unacceptable to the religious leaders of the day, yet Jesus chose him to demonstrate that God's kingdom is open to all who are willing to repent and follow Him.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's kingdom transcends social and cultural barriers. Matthew's work as a tax collector would have involved interaction with people from various social and cultural backgrounds, including Gentiles and Romans. By choosing Matthew, Jesus demonstrated that God's kingdom is not limited to any particular social or cultural group.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's kingdom is based on faith and repentance, not on social status or religious pedigree. Matthew had no religious credentials or social standing, yet Jesus chose him to demonstrate that entry into God's kingdom is based on faith in Jesus and repentance from sin.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew also demonstrates that God's kingdom is characterized by grace and mercy, not by judgment and exclusion. By choosing Matthew, Jesus demonstrated that God's kingdom is a place where sinners are welcomed and transformed, not excluded and condemned.</p><h2>Providing a Model of Transformation</h2><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew was also intended to provide a model of transformation and discipleship. Matthew's dramatic transformation from tax collector to apostle demonstrates the power of Jesus' call and the possibility of radical change in the lives of those who follow Him.</p><p>Matthew's transformation provides a model of what is possible when someone responds to Jesus' call. His immediate response to Jesus' call and his subsequent transformation demonstrate that Jesus' call has the power to change lives dramatically and to transform even the most unlikely individuals into faithful disciples.</p><p>Matthew's transformation also provides a model of the radical nature of discipleship.

His subsequent role as an apostle and author of the Gospel that bears his name demonstrates that discipleship is not just about initial conversion but about ongoing growth and service to God and others.</p><h2>Fulfilling Prophetic Patterns</h2><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew may also have been intended to fulfill certain prophetic patterns and to demonstrate the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah and His ministry.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew may have been intended to fulfill the prophetic pattern of God choosing the unlikely and the marginalized. Throughout the Old Testament, God often chose unlikely individuals to serve Him, including shepherds, farmers, and other ordinary people. By choosing Matthew, Jesus was continuing this pattern and demonstrating that God's ways are not our ways.</p><p>Jesus' choice of Matthew may also have been intended to fulfill the prophetic expectation that the Messiah would bring good news to the poor and marginalized.
