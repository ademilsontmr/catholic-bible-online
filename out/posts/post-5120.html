    <article><h2>Introduction: Original Sin and Infant Baptism</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? This question addresses one of the most fundamental aspects of Catholic sacramental theology. Psalm 51:5 and Romans 5:12 provide the biblical foundation for this understanding. Psalm 51:5 states: 'Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.' Romans 5:12 teaches: 'Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned.' These verses reveal that all human beings are born with original sin and need the cleansing grace of baptism.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that original sin is a reality that affects all human beings from the moment of conception, and that baptism is the ordinary means through which this sin is washed away. Since infants are born with original sin, they need baptism to be cleansed and to receive the grace of salvation. This understanding is not based on human tradition alone but on the consistent witness of Scripture and the teaching of the Church throughout the centuries.</p><h2>The Context of Psalm 51:5</h2><p>To understand why original sin requires infant baptism, we must examine the context of Psalm 51:5. This verse is part of David's prayer of repentance after his sin with Bathsheba. The verse reads: 'Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.'</p><p>This verse shows that sin is not just something we choose to do but is a condition that affects us from the very beginning of our existence. The fact that David speaks of being 'born guilty' and 'a sinner when my mother conceived me' suggests that sin is present from the moment of conception, not just from the moment of birth.</p><p>This understanding is fundamental to Catholic theology and shows that original sin is a reality that affects all human beings from the very beginning of their existence.</p><h2>The Context of Romans 5:12</h2><p>To understand why original sin requires infant baptism, we must also examine Romans 5:12. Saint Paul writes: 'Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned.'</p><p>This verse shows that sin entered the world through Adam and that this sin has affected all human beings. The phrase 'death spread to all because all have sinned' suggests that all people are affected by sin, not just those who have committed personal sins. This understanding supports the Catholic teaching about original sin.</p><p>The universal nature of sin's effects shows that all human beings, including infants, are affected by original sin and need the cleansing grace of baptism.</p><h2>The Nature of Original Sin</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? The nature of original sin is fundamental to this understanding. Original sin is not a personal sin that we commit but a condition that we inherit from our first parents, Adam and Eve. This sin affects our human nature and makes us prone to sin and separated from God.</p><p>Original sin is like a spiritual disease that affects all human beings from the moment of conception. It darkens our intellect, weakens our will, and disorders our passions. This condition makes us incapable of achieving salvation on our own and in need of God's grace to be saved.</p><p>The nature of original sin shows that all human beings, including infants, need the cleansing grace of baptism to be freed from this condition.</p><h2>The Effects of Original Sin</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? The effects of original sin are profound and affect every aspect of human existence. Original sin separates us from God, makes us prone to sin, and subjects us to death. These effects are present from the moment of conception and affect all human beings, regardless of age.</p><p>The effects of original sin include the loss of sanctifying grace, the darkening of the intellect, the weakening of the will, and the disorder of the passions. These effects make us incapable of achieving salvation on our own and in need of God's grace to be saved.</p><p>The effects of original sin show that all human beings, including infants, need the cleansing grace of baptism to be freed from these effects.</p><h2>The Necessity of Baptism</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? The necessity of baptism for salvation is fundamental to this understanding. Jesus says in John 3:5: 'Unless one is born of water and Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.' This necessity applies to all people, including infants who are born with original sin.</p><p>While the Church recognizes that God is not bound by the sacraments and can save people in extraordinary ways, the ordinary means of salvation is through baptism. Since infants are born with original sin and since baptism is necessary for salvation, the Church believes that infants should be baptized.</p><p>The necessity of baptism shows that infant baptism is not optional but is the ordinary means through which infants are freed from original sin and receive the grace of salvation.</p><h2>The Grace of Baptism</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? The grace of baptism is the means through which original sin is washed away. Baptism is not just a human ritual but a sacrament through which God confers grace. This grace cleanses us from original sin and gives us new life in Christ.</p><p>Through baptism, we receive sanctifying grace, which restores our relationship with God and makes us capable of living as children of God. We also receive the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, which enable us to relate to God in a new way.</p><p>The grace of baptism shows that infant baptism is not just about removing original sin but about giving infants the grace to live as children of God.</p><h2>The Historical Teaching</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? The historical teaching of the Church provides strong evidence for this understanding. From the earliest times, the Church has taught that all human beings are born with original sin and need baptism to be cleansed.</p><p>The early Church Fathers, such as Saint Augustine, Saint Cyprian, and Saint Irenaeus, all taught that original sin affects all human beings and that baptism is necessary to be freed from this condition. This teaching has been consistently maintained throughout the centuries.</p><p>The historical teaching shows that the understanding of original sin and the necessity of infant baptism is not a later development but has been part of the Church's teaching from the beginning.</p><h2>The Gift of Grace</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? Since baptism is a gift of God's grace, it should not be withheld from anyone, including infants. The Church believes that God's grace is available to all people, regardless of age, and that infants should not be denied this gift simply because they are too young to understand it.</p><p>Since original sin affects all human beings from the moment of conception, and since baptism is the ordinary means through which this sin is washed away, the Church believes that infants should be baptized as soon as possible after birth.</p><p>The gift of grace shows that infant baptism is not about earning salvation but about receiving the gift of God's grace that frees us from original sin.</p><h2>Conclusion: The Necessity of Grace</h2><p>Why does original sin require infant baptism? Because all human beings are born with original sin and need the cleansing grace of baptism to be freed from this condition and to receive the gift of salvation. The biblical evidence, the nature of original sin, and the historical teaching of the Church all support this understanding.</p><p>As we reflect on Psalm 51:5 and Romans 5:12, let us be grateful for the gift of baptism and the way it frees us from original sin. May we always remember that through infant baptism, we are welcoming children into the life of grace and freeing them from the effects of original sin.</p><h2>Prayer for Original Sin</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, thank You for the gift of baptism and the way it frees us from original sin. Help us to understand the profound mystery of original sin and the necessity of baptism for salvation. May we always remember that through infant baptism, we are welcoming children into Your kingdom and freeing them from the effects of original sin. Give us the wisdom to appreciate the gift of grace that You offer to all people, regardless of age. In Your name we pray, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
