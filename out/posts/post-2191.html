    <h1>Gospel of John: Themes of Love and Faith</h1>
    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Unique Features of John's Gospel</h2><p>The Gospel of John is different from the other three Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). It was written later, around 90-100 AD, and focuses more on Jesus' divinity and spiritual teachings than on his miracles and parables. John's Gospel is more theological and symbolic, using themes like light and darkness, life and death, and love and hate.</p><h2>The Word Made Flesh</h2><p>John begins his Gospel with the famous prologue: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' This passage identifies Jesus as the eternal Word of God who became human. The phrase 'the Word became flesh' (John 1:14) is the foundation of the doctrine of the Incarnation.</p><h2>Seven Signs and Miracles</h2><p>John's Gospel focuses on seven key miracles that he calls 'signs': turning water into wine, healing the official's son, healing the paralytic, feeding the 5,000, walking on water, healing the blind man, and raising Lazarus. These signs reveal Jesus' divinity and point to deeper spiritual truths.</p><h2>I AM Sayings of Jesus</h2><p>John's Gospel contains seven 'I AM' statements where Jesus identifies himself with divine titles: I AM the bread of life, the light of the world, the gate, the good shepherd, the resurrection and the life, the way and the truth and the life, and the true vine. These statements reveal Jesus' divine nature and his relationship with believers.</p><h2>The Last Supper Discourse</h2><p>John's account of the Last Supper includes Jesus' long farewell discourse (chapters 14-17), where he speaks about love, the Holy Spirit, and the unity of believers. This discourse contains some of Jesus' most beautiful teachings about love and the Christian life.</p><h2>Love as Central Theme</h2><p>Love is the central theme of John's Gospel. Jesus' command to 'love one another as I have loved you' (John 15:12) is repeated throughout the Gospel. John emphasizes that love is not just a feeling but an action - serving others, laying down our lives for others, and keeping God's commandments.</p><h2>John's Vision of Faith</h2><p>John's Gospel presents faith as a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Faith is not just believing facts about Jesus, but trusting in him and following him. John's purpose in writing is 'that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name' (John 20:31).</p></article>
