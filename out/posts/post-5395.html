    <article><h2>The Arian Controversy and the Need for a Creed</h2>
<p>The history of the Nicene Creed begins with the Arian controversy, which threatened to divide the early Church over the nature of Christ. The history of the Nicene Creed shows that in the early fourth century, a priest named Arius began teaching that Jesus Christ was not truly divine but was a created being. The history of the Nicene Creed recognizes that this teaching, known as Arianism, spread rapidly and caused great confusion and division in the Church. The history of the Nicene Creed reveals that Emperor Constantine, concerned about the unity of his empire, convened the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD to address this controversy and establish a clear statement of Christian belief.</p>

<h2>The Council of Nicaea and the Original Creed</h2>
<p>The history of the Nicene Creed includes the dramatic events of the First Council of Nicaea, where over 300 bishops gathered to address the Arian controversy. The history of the Nicene Creed shows that this council was marked by intense debate and theological discussion, as the bishops worked to find the right words to express the Church's belief in the divinity of Christ. The history of the Nicene Creed recognizes that the key issue was finding language that would clearly affirm that Jesus Christ is "of the same substance" (homoousios) as the Father, meaning that He is truly divine. The history of the Nicene Creed reveals that after much discussion and prayer, the council produced a creed that clearly affirmed the divinity of Christ and the unity of the Trinity.</p>
