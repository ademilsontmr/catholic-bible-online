    <article><h2>What is Catholic Social Teaching?</h2><p>Catholic Social Teaching is the Church's body of doctrine on matters of social justice, human dignity, and the common good. It provides principles for building a just society and guides Catholics in their social and political decisions. This teaching is based on Scripture, Tradition, and the Church's reflection on social issues throughout history.</p><h2>Human Dignity</h2><p>The foundation of Catholic Social Teaching is the belief that every human being is created in the image and likeness of God and therefore has inherent dignity and worth. This dignity is not earned or given by society, but is a gift from God. It means that every person deserves respect, regardless of their race, religion, economic status, or any other characteristic.</p><h2>The Common Good</h2><p>The common good is the sum total of social conditions that allow people to reach their full potential. It includes things like peace, security, education, healthcare, and a healthy environment. Catholics are called to work for the common good, not just their own individual interests.</p><h2>Solidarity</h2><p>Solidarity is the virtue that calls us to recognize that we are all part of one human family. It means standing with others, especially the poor and vulnerable, and working for their good. Solidarity calls us to overcome divisions and work together for justice and peace.</p><h2>Subsidiarity</h2><p>Subsidiarity is the principle that decisions should be made at the lowest level possible. This means that individuals, families, and local communities should have the freedom to make decisions about their own lives, while larger institutions (like government) should only step in when necessary.</p><h2>Care for Creation</h2><p>Catholic Social Teaching emphasizes our responsibility to care for God's creation. This includes protecting the environment, using natural resources responsibly, and working to address climate change. Care for creation is part of our stewardship of God's gifts.</p><h2>Applying Social Teaching</h2><p>Catholic Social Teaching is not just theory; it's meant to be lived. This means making choices in our daily lives that promote justice and peace. It might mean buying fair trade products, volunteering to help the poor, or advocating for just policies. Every Catholic is called to be a witness to justice and peace.</p></article>
