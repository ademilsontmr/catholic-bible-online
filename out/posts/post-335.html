    <h1>The Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>On the road to Damascus, Saul is overtaken by light and addressed by the Risen Lord. He falls, listens, and is sent. The feast reveals conversion as encounter: not self-improvement alone, but surrender to a Person who reorients desire and mission.</p><h2>Marks of True Conversion</h2><ul><li><strong>Truth:</strong> Paul admits he was wrong; humility opens the door.</li><li><strong>Baptism and Community:</strong> Ananias welcomes him; conversion inserts us into the Church.</li><li><strong>Mission:</strong> The convert becomes a witness; zeal now serves love.</li></ul><h2>For Us Today</h2><p>Conversion may be sudden or slow; in both, grace acts. We meet Christ in Scripture, sacraments, the poor, and the voice of conscience. Daily conversion looks like prayerful listening, confession, reconciliation, and courageous witness.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Lord Jesus, light of the nations, convert our hearts anew. Like Paul, make us fearless in proclaiming your Gospel in word and deed. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
