    <article><h2>Introduction: Lending to the Lord</h2>
<p>Sharing with the poor represents one of the most important expressions of Christian charity. The wisdom of Proverbs 19:17, "Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed," provides the foundation for understanding how helping the poor is like lending to the Lord Himself. This sharing involves recognizing that when we help those in need, we are not just helping other people but are serving and honoring God Himself.</p>

<p>When we understand sharing with the poor, we recognize that this is not just about charity but about recognizing Christ in the poor and serving Him through our generosity. This understanding helps us to see that helping the poor is a sacred act that honors God and brings His blessing.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Biblical Foundation of Helping the Poor</h2>
<p>Sharing with the poor begins with understanding the biblical foundation of caring for the poor and its importance in the Christian life. The Bible repeatedly emphasizes the importance of helping the poor, from the Old Testament's teachings about caring for the needy to Jesus' teachings about serving the least of these. Scripture consistently shows that helping the poor is essential to living as God's people.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that sharing with the poor is about recognizing that this is God's plan for how we should care for others. When we understand this, we can approach helping the poor with reverence and dedication rather than mere obligation.</p>

<h2>Seeing Christ in the Poor</h2>
<p>Sharing with the poor includes seeing Christ in those who are in need and serving Him through our generosity. This involves recognizing that when we help the poor, we are serving Christ Himself, treating the poor with the same love and respect we would show to Christ, understanding that our generosity to the poor honors God, and seeing that helping the poor is a way to worship and serve God. The key is to see Christ in everyone we help.</p>

<p>This Christ seeing shows that sharing with the poor is about recognizing that we are serving Christ when we help those in need. When we see Christ in the poor, we approach helping them with love and reverence.</p>

<h2>Trusting in God's Promise of Repayment</h2>
<p>Sharing with the poor involves trusting in God's promise that He will repay us for our kindness to the poor. This might involve believing that God sees and values our generosity to the poor, trusting that God will bless us for our kindness, understanding that our generosity to the poor brings God's favor, or finding confidence in knowing that God will repay us for our deeds. The key is to trust that God is faithful to His promise to repay our kindness.</p>

<p>This trust shows that sharing with the poor is about having confidence in God's promise to repay our kindness. When we trust in God's promise, we can give generously to the poor with confidence and joy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Sacred Act of Worship</h2>
<p>Sharing with the poor reveals that helping those in need is a sacred act that honors God and brings His blessing. When we share with the poor, we are lending to the Lord and can trust in His promise of repayment.</p>

<p>As we work to share with the poor, let us remember that whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord. When we help those in need with love and generosity, we honor God and can trust in His promise to repay us for our deeds.</p></article>
