    <article><h2>The Call to Pray for Conversions</h2><p>Praying for the conversion of souls is one of the most important ministries of intercessory prayer. Jesus came to save souls, and He calls us to participate in this mission through prayer. When we pray for someone's conversion, we are asking God to touch their heart and draw them to Himself.</p><p>Conversion is ultimately God's work, but He often uses our prayers as a means of grace. Our prayers create an opening for God to work in someone's life.</p><h2>How to Pray for Conversions</h2><p>When praying for someone's conversion:</p><h3>1. Pray with Love</h3><p>Pray out of love for the person, not out of judgment or condemnation. Remember that God loves them more than you do.</p><h3>2. Pray for Specific Needs</h3><p>Pray for specific obstacles to their conversion - pride, doubt, past hurts, or other barriers.</p><h3>3. Pray for Opportunities</h3><p>Pray that God will create opportunities for them to encounter Him - through people, events, or circumstances.</p><h3>4. Pray Persistently</h3><p>Don't give up. Some conversions take years of prayer. Trust in God's timing.</p><h2>Praying for Family and Friends</h2><p>It's natural to want our family and friends to know Christ. Pray for them daily, asking God to draw them to Himself. Remember that your own example of faith and love may be the most powerful witness.</p><h2>Praying for the World</h2><p>Pray for the conversion of the world - for all people to come to know Christ. This is a prayer that aligns with God's will, for He desires all people to be saved.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Praying for the conversion of souls is a beautiful ministry that can have eternal consequences. Let us be faithful in this important work of intercessory prayer.</p></article>
