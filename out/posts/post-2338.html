    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Adoption Ministry</h2><p>Adoption ministry is deeply rooted in Scripture and Catholic teaching about the dignity of every human person and the call to care for the vulnerable. The Bible repeatedly calls us to care for orphans and to provide for those who are in need. James 1:27 tells us that 'Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction.' The Bible also shows us that adoption is a beautiful reflection of God's love, as we are all adopted as children of God through Christ. Catholic teaching emphasizes that every child has the right to a loving family and that adoption and foster care are noble ways to live out our faith. This biblical foundation shows us that adoption ministry is not just about providing services, but about living out our faith through love and care for children in need.</p><h2>Understanding Catholic Adoption Ministry</h2><p>Catholic adoption ministry provides support and guidance to families who are considering adoption or foster care, as well as to children who are in need of loving homes.
