    <h1>Why Marriage Requires Daily Sacrifice (Luke 9:23)</h1>
    <p><em>2025-01-27</em></p>
    <article><h2>The Call to Daily Sacrifice</h2>
<p>Marriage requires daily sacrifice, as Jesus teaches us in Luke 9:23: "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." This call to daily sacrifice applies not just to individual discipleship but also to married life. When couples are married, they are called to deny themselves and to take up their cross daily for the good of their spouse and their marriage.</p>

<p>This daily sacrifice is not just about giving up things that we want but is about putting the needs of our spouse before our own needs. It is about being willing to make small sacrifices every day - sacrificing our time, our energy, our preferences, our comfort, and our desires for the good of our marriage. This sacrifice is not a burden but is a gift that helps us to grow in love and holiness.</p>

<h2>Sacrifice as an Expression of Love</h2>
<p>Sacrifice in marriage is not just about duty or obligation but is an expression of love. When we love someone, we naturally want to do things for them and to put their needs before our own. This is the kind of love that Christ showed for the Church when He sacrificed Himself on the cross. Married couples are called to love each other with the same self-sacrificing love.</p>

<p>This sacrificial love is expressed in many ways in daily married life - in the way we speak to each other, in the way we treat each other, in the way we serve each other, and in the way we support each other. When we make sacrifices for our spouse, we are showing them that we love them and that we are committed to their happiness and well-being. This sacrifice helps to strengthen our love and to deepen our relationship.</p>

<h2>The Small Sacrifices of Daily Life</h2>
<p>Most of the sacrifices required in marriage are small, everyday sacrifices that may seem insignificant but are actually very important. These include sacrificing our time to listen to our spouse, sacrificing our preferences to accommodate our spouse's needs, sacrificing our comfort to care for our spouse when they are sick, and sacrificing our desires to support our spouse's dreams and goals.</p>

<p>These small sacrifices may not seem like much, but they add up over time and help to build a strong and lasting marriage. When we make these small sacrifices consistently, we are showing our spouse that we love them and that we are committed to their happiness. These sacrifices also help us to grow in virtue and to become more like Christ.</p>

<h2>Sacrifice and Communication</h2>
<p>Sacrifice in marriage also involves being willing to sacrifice our pride and our need to be right in order to communicate effectively with our spouse. This means being willing to listen to our spouse's perspective, to admit when we are wrong, to apologize when we have hurt our spouse, and to work together to resolve conflicts and disagreements.</p>

<p>This sacrifice of pride is essential for good communication in marriage. When we are willing to sacrifice our pride, we are better able to understand our spouse's perspective, to empathize with their feelings, and to work together to find solutions to problems. This sacrifice helps to create an environment of trust and safety where communication can flourish.</p>

<h2>Sacrifice and Forgiveness</h2>
<p>Sacrifice in marriage also involves being willing to sacrifice our right to hold grudges and to seek revenge in order to forgive our spouse. This means being willing to let go of past hurts, to forgive our spouse when they have wronged us, and to seek reconciliation when conflicts arise. This sacrifice is not easy, but it is essential for building a strong and lasting marriage.</p>

<p>This sacrifice of our right to hold grudges is essential for forgiveness in marriage. When we are willing to sacrifice this right, we are better able to forgive our spouse and to move forward in our relationship. This sacrifice helps to create an environment of love and forgiveness where our marriage can flourish.</p>

<h2>Sacrifice and Service</h2>
<p>Sacrifice in marriage also involves being willing to serve our spouse and to put their needs before our own. This means being willing to do things for our spouse that we might not want to do, to care for our spouse when they are sick or in need, and to support our spouse in their dreams and goals. This service is not about being a doormat but is about loving our spouse as Christ loves the Church.</p>

<p>This sacrifice of service is essential for building a strong and lasting marriage. When we are willing to serve our spouse, we are showing them that we love them and that we are committed to their happiness and well-being. This service also helps us to grow in virtue and to become more like Christ, who came not to be served but to serve.</p>

<h2>Sacrifice and Growth</h2>
<p>Sacrifice in marriage is not just about giving up things but is also about growing in virtue and holiness. When we make sacrifices for our spouse, we are growing in virtues like patience, kindness, generosity, and self-control. These virtues help us to become better people and better spouses.</p>

<p>This growth in virtue is essential for building a strong and lasting marriage. When we grow in virtue, we are better able to love our spouse, to communicate effectively, to resolve conflicts, and to fulfill our vocation. This growth also helps us to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Gift, Not a Burden</h2>
<p>Daily sacrifice in marriage is not a burden but is a gift that helps us to grow in love and holiness. When we make sacrifices for our spouse, we are showing them that we love them and that we are committed to their happiness and well-being. These sacrifices also help us to grow in virtue and to become more like Christ.</p>

<p>As we reflect on the importance of daily sacrifice in marriage, let us remember that this sacrifice is not just about giving up things but is about growing in love and holiness. When we make sacrifices for our spouse, we are building a strong and lasting marriage that serves God and helps to build up His kingdom on earth.</p></article>
