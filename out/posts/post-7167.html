    <p><em>2024-12-21</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Values as Political Foundation</h2><p>How Catholic values guide American political engagement is about recognizing that Catholic values are not just religious principles or moral guidelines, but powerful guides for understanding and practicing political participation in American democracy that help American Catholics to fulfill their civic responsibilities with wisdom and moral integrity, and to work for the common good in ways that promote human dignity and social justice. When American Catholics use these values to guide their political engagement effectively, they're not just participating in politics or fulfilling civic obligations, but actively participating in God's work of building a more just and compassionate American democracy where all citizens can participate in the political process and work together for the common good. This political guidance is not about imposing religious values on others or about creating a theocracy, but about using Catholic values to guide political participation and to help build a democracy that reflects the values of the Gospel.</p><p>Throughout American history, Catholic citizens have played a vital role in American political life, contributing to various aspects of American democracy through their commitment to faith, family, and community. From the early Catholic settlers who worked to build schools, hospitals, and other community institutions to the modern Catholic citizens who continue to serve in various capacities in government, education, healthcare, and other fields, Catholic citizens have been powerful forces for good in American life. When American Catholics use these values to guide their political engagement effectively, they can help to transform American democracy and to create a more just and compassionate society.</p><h2>How Catholic Values Guide Political Engagement</h2><p>Catholic values guide political engagement in several important ways. First, they provide a moral and spiritual foundation that helps American Catholics to understand their responsibility to work for the common good and to fulfill their civic duties with wisdom and moral integrity. Second, they offer principles and values that can guide political participation, such as the preferential option for the poor, the principle of solidarity, and the call to work for the common good. Third, they help American Catholics to understand that true political participation comes not from pursuing partisan interests but from working together to build a democracy that reflects the values of the Gospel and serves the common good. Fourth, they provide spiritual resources and practices that can help people to find strength and courage in their political participation, and to persevere even when faced with various challenges and difficulties. Fifth, they bear witness to the truth that political participation is not just a civic right but a moral and spiritual calling that flows from our relationship with God.</p><h2>Conclusion: Values as Political Mission</h2><p>How Catholic values guide American political engagement is ultimately about recognizing our calling to use Catholic values to guide our political participation and to help build a more just and compassionate American democracy, and about helping American Catholics to understand that true political participation comes not from pursuing partisan interests but from working together to build a democracy that reflects the values of the Gospel and serves the common good. When American Catholics use these values to guide their political engagement effectively, they're not just participating in politics or fulfilling civic obligations, but actively participating in God's work of building a more just and compassionate American democracy. This political guidance becomes a powerful tool for evangelization and social transformation, helping American Catholics to work together for a democracy that reflects the values of the Gospel and serves the common good.</p><h2>Prayer for Political Engagement</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help American Catholics to use Catholic values effectively to guide their political engagement, recognizing that You call us to work for the common good and to fulfill our civic duties with wisdom and moral integrity. Give us the wisdom to understand how to engage in politics effectively, the courage to work for the common good even when it's difficult, and the commitment to help build a democracy that reflects Your values and serves the common good. May our Catholic values become a powerful foundation for political engagement and help us to work together for a better future. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
