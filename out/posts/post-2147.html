    <article><h2>Redemptive Suffering</h2><p>Redemptive suffering is the Catholic teaching that our sufferings can have value when offered to God for the good of others. This is not about seeking suffering, but about using the sufferings that come our way to help others through prayer.</p><p>Saint Paul wrote, 'I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body, which is the church' (Colossians 1:24). This means that our sufferings can be united with Christ's sufferings and used for the salvation of souls.</p><h2>How to Offer Suffering for Others</h2><p>When we experience suffering - physical pain, emotional pain, or any kind of difficulty - we can offer it to God for the good of others. We can say a simple prayer like, 'Jesus, I offer this suffering for [name of person or intention].'</p><p>This doesn't mean that the suffering will go away, but it means that God can use it to help others. Our suffering becomes a prayer, a sacrifice that we offer to God for the good of others.</p><h2>Examples of Redemptive Suffering</h2><p>Many saints have offered their sufferings for others. Saint Therese of Lisieux offered her sufferings for the conversion of sinners. Saint Padre Pio offered his sufferings for the souls in purgatory. Saint Maximilian Kolbe offered his life for another man in Auschwitz.</p><p>We don't need to be saints to offer our sufferings for others. Even small sufferings - a headache, a difficult day at work, or a disappointment - can be offered to God for the good of others.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Redemptive suffering is a beautiful way to pray for others. When we offer our sufferings to God, we are participating in Christ's redemptive work and helping others through our prayers. Let us make use of this gift by offering our sufferings for the good of others.</p></article>
