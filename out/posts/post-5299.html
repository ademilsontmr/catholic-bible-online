    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Being Holy Together</h2>
<p>The call to be holy together in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in 1 Peter 1:15-16: "But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" This passage shows that holiness is not just an individual calling but is a calling that married couples share together. When couples answer the call to be holy together, they are not just being religious but are actively participating in God's work of sanctification and growing in holiness as a couple.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that being holy together is not just about individual holiness but is about growing in holiness as a couple and supporting each other in the journey toward sanctification. When couples answer the call to be holy together, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This call is not about being perfect but is about being willing to grow in holiness together.</p>

<h2>Holiness as a Shared Journey</h2>
<p>The call to be holy together in Catholic marriage recognizes that holiness is a shared journey that couples undertake together. Just as God calls each individual to be holy, so too does He call married couples to be holy together and to support each other in their journey toward sanctification. This holiness is not about being perfect but is about being willing to grow in holiness together.</p>

<p>When couples answer the call to be holy together, they are not just being religious but are actively participating in a shared journey toward holiness. They are able to support each other in their spiritual growth, to pray together for holiness, to encourage each other in virtuous living, to help each other overcome sin and temptation, and to grow in holiness together as a couple. This holiness becomes a powerful shared journey that strengthens their marriage.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Being Holy Together</h2>
<p>Answering the call to be holy together is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes supporting each other in spiritual growth, praying together for holiness, encouraging each other in virtuous living, helping each other overcome sin and temptation, and growing in holiness together.

When couples practice being holy together in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and holy.</p>

<h2>Being Holy Together and Communication</h2>
<p>Answering the call to be holy together is closely connected to communication. When couples are able to communicate about their spiritual growth and their desire for holiness, they are better able to be holy together effectively. Good communication helps couples to discuss their spiritual needs, to share their struggles and victories, and to support each other in their journey toward holiness.</p>

When couples grow in these virtues, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>
