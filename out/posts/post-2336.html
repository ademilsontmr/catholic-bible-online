    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Divorce Ministry</h2><p>Divorce ministry is deeply rooted in Scripture and Catholic teaching about marriage, healing, and God's mercy.

Catholic teaching recognizes that divorce is a complex and painful experience that affects individuals, families, and communities, and that those who have experienced divorce need special care and support.
