    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Mary in the Infancy Narratives</h2><p>Scripture presents Mary as central to the incarnation story, beginning with the Annunciation in Luke's Gospel. Catholic tradition sees Mary's 'yes' to God's plan as the model of perfect faith and obedience. Her role as the Mother of God (Theotokos) is foundational to Catholic understanding of the incarnation and the dignity of human nature. Mary's presence in the infancy narratives shows her importance in God's plan of salvation and her unique role in bringing Christ into the world.</p><h2>The Annunciation and Mary's Fiat</h2><p>Luke's account of the Annunciation (1:26-38) shows Mary as the model of faith and discipleship. Her response, 'Let it be done to me according to your word,' represents perfect cooperation with God's grace. Catholic teaching emphasizes that Mary's fiat (let it be done) is the pattern for all Christian discipleship. Her willingness to accept God's plan, despite the challenges it would bring, shows the depth of her faith and trust in God. This biblical account establishes Mary's role as the model of faith.</p><h2>Mary's Magnificat</h2><p>Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) is one of the most important texts in Catholic tradition. This song of praise reveals Mary's deep understanding of God's plan and her role in it. Catholic interpretation sees the Magnificat as expressing God's preferential option for the poor and His commitment to justice. Mary's song emphasizes how God 'has scattered the proud' and 'exalted those of low degree,' establishing themes that will be central to Jesus' ministry. This biblical text shows Mary's prophetic understanding of God's work.</p><h2>Mary at the Wedding at Cana</h2><p>John's Gospel presents Mary at the wedding at Cana (2:1-11), where she intercedes for the couple and prompts Jesus' first miracle. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary's role as intercessor and showing her concern for human needs. Her instruction to the servants, 'Do whatever he tells you,' is seen as Mary's ongoing message to all believers. This episode reveals Mary's maternal care for the Church and her role in bringing people to Jesus. This biblical account establishes Mary's role as intercessor.</p><h2>Mary at the Foot of the Cross</h2><p>John's Gospel places Mary at the foot of the cross (19:25-27), where Jesus entrusts her to the beloved disciple and the disciple to her. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary as the Mother of the Church and showing her participation in Christ's redemptive work. Her presence at the cross demonstrates her complete identification with Jesus' mission and her willingness to share in His suffering. This biblical account establishes Mary's role as Mother of the Church.</p><h2>Mary in the Early Church</h2><p>Acts 1:14 shows Mary present with the apostles in the Upper Room after Jesus' ascension, praying for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Catholic tradition sees this as establishing Mary's role in the birth of the Church and her ongoing intercession for the Church. Her presence with the apostles shows her importance in the early Christian community and her role as a model of prayer and discipleship. This biblical account shows Mary's role in the Church's foundation.</p><h2>Mary as the New Eve</h2><p>Catholic tradition sees Mary as the new Eve, whose obedience to God reverses the disobedience of the first Eve. Just as Eve's 'no' to God brought sin into the world, Mary's 'yes' to God brings salvation. This typological interpretation helps Catholics understand Mary's role in God's plan of redemption and her importance in salvation history. This understanding shows how Mary participates in Christ's redemptive work.</p><h2>Contemporary Applications</h2><p>Understanding Mary's role in salvation history helps modern Catholics appreciate her importance in the Christian life. Mary's example of faith, obedience, and intercession provides guidance for contemporary discipleship. This understanding helps Catholics grow in their relationship with Mary and through her to Jesus. The biblical foundation of Mary's role helps Catholics explain and defend devotion to Mary to others.</p></article>
