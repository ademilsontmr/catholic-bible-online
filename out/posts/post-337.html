    <h1>The Feast of the Visitation</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: The Visitation</h2><p>The Feast of the Visitation celebrates the meeting between Mary and Elizabeth (Lk 1:39–56). Mary, carrying Christ, goes “in haste”; Elizabeth, filled with the Spirit, blesses her; John leaps for joy; and Mary sings the Magnificat.</p><h2>Grace in Motion</h2><p>Mary shows that true contemplation overflows into mission: grace received becomes grace given. She is the first tabernacle and the first evangelist of the New Covenant.</p><h2>Biblical Echoes</h2><p>Like the ark of the covenant traveling to the hill country, Mary—the Ark of the New Covenant—brings the Lord to another home. Elizabeth proclaims Mary blessed for believing God’s promise.</p><h2>The Magnificat</h2><p>Mary’s hymn magnifies God’s mercy and reverses worldly pride. It teaches us to praise first, remember God’s deeds, and live for the poor and lowly.</p><h2>Living the Feast</h2><ul><li>Go “in haste” toward those who need help.</li><li>Let your words carry Christ’s presence.</li><li>Pray the Magnificat daily.</li></ul><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Lord Jesus, whom Mary carried to Elizabeth, visit our homes today. Make our words vessels of the Spirit and our steps swift in love. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
