    <article><h2>Learning from a Quiet Disciple</h2><p>James the son of Alphaeus, often referred to as James the Less, provides a unique and valuable model of discipleship that is particularly relevant for contemporary Christians. While the biblical accounts provide limited information about his specific activities and contributions, what we do know about James offers important insights into what it means to be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. His example demonstrates that discipleship is not about prominence or recognition, but about faithful service and commitment to following Jesus wherever He leads.</p><p>James the son of Alphaeus's approach to discipleship was characterized by quiet faithfulness, steady commitment, and reliable service. Unlike some of the more prominent apostles who are frequently mentioned in the Gospel accounts, James appears to have taken a more behind-the-scenes approach to discipleship, serving faithfully without seeking recognition or prominence.

Understanding his approach to discipleship helps us develop our own understanding of what it means to follow Jesus faithfully.</p><p>James the son of Alphaeus's discipleship also demonstrates the importance of diversity in the Christian community.
