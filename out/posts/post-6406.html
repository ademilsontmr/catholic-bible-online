The Church teaches that Mary's suffering at the Cross demonstrates perfect spiritual union while showing that authentic participation in redemption requires both love and sacrifice that serves both divine glory and human salvation. This co-redemptive dimension demonstrates how Mary's role in redemption serves both theological understanding and spiritual formation while showing that her participation in Christ's passion provides the model for all Christian participation in redemptive suffering through faithful acceptance of suffering that serves both personal sanctification and the salvation of others through spiritual union with Christ's redemptive work.</p><h2>Spiritual Motherhood and Mediation</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary's redemptive role includes attention to her spiritual motherhood while recognizing that her maternal care for all believers flows from her participation in redemption and enables her to serve as Mediatrix who applies redemptive benefits to individual souls through maternal intercession that serves both immediate spiritual needs and eternal spiritual welfare. The Church understands Mary's spiritual motherhood as flowing from her redemptive participation while demonstrating that authentic cooperation with salvation enables continuing mission of spiritual service and assistance that benefits all who seek divine grace and mercy. This maternal dimension demonstrates how Mary's role in redemption continues through her heavenly mission while showing that her redemptive cooperation establishes her authority and ability to serve as spiritual mother and advocate for all believers who benefit from her maternal care and powerful intercession that flows from her perfect participation in Christ's redemptive work.</p><h2>Contemporary Significance and Application</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on Mary's redemptive role emphasize contemporary significance while promoting understanding of her participation as providing essential guidance for all believers who seek to participate in Christ's continuing redemptive mission through the Church and individual Christian witness that serves both personal sanctification and the salvation of others through faithful discipleship and spiritual service.
