    <h1>Why Every Catholic Is Called to Engage in Politics</h1>
    <p><em>2024-12-19</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: A Baptismal Call</h2><p>Every Catholic is called to engage in politics, not as an optional activity or a matter of personal preference, but as a moral obligation that flows directly from our baptismal call to be salt and light in the world. This call is rooted in the understanding that we are called to transform the world around us, not to withdraw from it.</p><p>Politics, understood broadly as the way we organize our common life together, affects every aspect of human flourishing. From the protection of human life to the care for creation, from the education of children to the care for the elderly, political decisions shape the conditions in which we live out our faith and serve our neighbors.</p><h2>The Salt and Light Mandate</h2><p>Jesus tells us that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. Salt preserves and enhances flavor, while light dispels darkness and shows the way forward. In the political realm, this means that Catholics are called to preserve what is good in society while working to enhance the common good.</p><p>We are called to be light by bringing the truth of the Gospel to bear on political questions, illuminating the path toward policies that respect human dignity and promote the common good. This is not about imposing our faith on others, but about bringing the wisdom of our faith tradition to the public square.</p><h2>Forming Consciences, Not Imposing Faith</h2><p>Catholic political engagement is not about creating a theocracy or imposing Catholic doctrine on non-Catholics. Rather, it's about forming our own consciences according to Catholic teaching and then working to build a society that respects human dignity and promotes the common good.</p><p>This means that Catholics should be well-informed about the issues, guided by Catholic social teaching, and engaged in the political process through voting, advocacy, and sometimes running for office. We are called to be witnesses to the truth, not conquerors imposing our will.</p><h2>Conclusion: Faithful Citizenship</h2><p>Every Catholic is called to engage in politics because political decisions affect human dignity and the common good. This engagement is not optional but flows from our baptismal call to be salt and light in the world.</p><p>As faithful citizens, we are called to form our consciences, educate ourselves about the issues, and participate in the political process with wisdom and charity. In doing so, we fulfill our call to transform the world and bring the light of Christ to every aspect of human society.</p><h2>Prayer for Political Engagement</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to be salt and light in the political realm. Give us the wisdom to form our consciences according to Your truth and the courage to engage in politics for the sake of human dignity and the common good. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
