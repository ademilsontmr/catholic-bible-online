    <h1>The Feast of the Triumph of the Cross</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The Feast of the Triumph of the Cross proclaims that through the Cross Christ conquered sin and death. What once symbolized shame and failure becomes the tree of life. We do not glorify suffering for its own sake; we glorify the love that suffered for us and now transforms every trial from within.</p><h2>Scriptural Roots</h2><p>In Numbers 21, the bronze serpent lifted in the desert becomes a sign of healing for the bitten; in John 3, Jesus reveals that he will be lifted up so that all who believe may have eternal life. Paul declares that he will boast in nothing but the Cross (Gal 6:14). The Cross is revelation: of God’s justice that confronts sin and of God’s mercy that embraces sinners.</p><h2>Living Under the Sign of the Cross</h2><ul><li><strong>Identity:</strong> We trace the sign of the Cross to remember whose we are—beloved of the Father, redeemed by the Son, anointed by the Spirit.</li><li><strong>Discipleship:</strong> Taking up the Cross means daily fidelity: keeping promises, forgiving enemies, serving the weak.</li><li><strong>Hope:</strong> No wound is final where Christ reigns; every Calvary contains an Easter in seed.</li></ul><h2>The Cross and Healing</h2><p>Beneath the Cross, bitterness yields to intercession. We bring our sins to mercy, our memories to cleansing, our bodies and relationships to restoration. The Cross does not erase history; it redeems it.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you, because by your Holy Cross you have redeemed the world. Teach us to love as you love. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
