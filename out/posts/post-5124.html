    <article><h2>Introduction: Spiritual Protection Through Baptism</h2><p>What spiritual protection does infant baptism bring? This question addresses one of the most important aspects of the Catholic practice of infant baptism.

For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.' This verse reveals that we are engaged in a spiritual battle, and infant baptism provides the spiritual protection that children need to stand against the forces of evil.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that infant baptism provides spiritual protection by cleansing children from original sin, giving them the Holy Spirit, and incorporating them into the Body of Christ.
