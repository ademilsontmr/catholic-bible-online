    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Early Life and Conversion</h2><p>Saint Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 in Assisi, Italy, to a wealthy merchant family. As a young man, he was known for his love of parties and dreams of military glory. However, after being captured in battle and spending time in prison, Francis began to question his life's purpose. His conversion began when he heard Christ speak to him from a crucifix, saying, 'Francis, rebuild my Church.'</p><h2>The Call to Poverty</h2><p>Francis took Christ's words literally and began rebuilding the dilapidated church of San Damiano. But he soon realized that Christ was calling him to rebuild the Church spiritually, not just physically. Francis embraced radical poverty, giving up all his possessions and living as a beggar. He saw poverty as a way to imitate Christ and to be free from worldly attachments.</p><h2>Founding the Franciscan Order</h2><p>Francis attracted followers who were drawn to his simple, Gospel-centered way of life. In 1209, Pope Innocent III approved the Franciscan Order, which would become one of the most influential religious orders in the Church. The Franciscans, known for their brown robes and commitment to poverty, spread throughout Europe and the world.</p><h2>Love for All Creation</h2><p>Francis is perhaps best known for his love of nature and all God's creatures. He saw all creation as a reflection of God's love and called animals and even inanimate objects his brothers and sisters. His famous 'Canticle of the Sun' praises God for all creation. This love for creation makes him the patron saint of ecology and environmental protection.</p><h2>The Stigmata</h2><p>In 1224, while praying on Mount La Verna, Francis received the stigmata - the wounds of Christ's crucifixion appeared on his hands, feet, and side. This miraculous event confirmed Francis's deep union with Christ and his suffering. The stigmata remained with Francis for the rest of his life, causing him great pain but also bringing him closer to Christ.</p><h2>Famous Prayers and Writings</h2><p>Francis left behind several beautiful prayers and writings. His 'Prayer of Saint Francis' (though not actually written by him) captures his spirit of peace and service. His 'Canticle of the Sun' is a beautiful hymn of praise to God for all creation. His simple rule of life emphasized poverty, chastity, and obedience.</p><h2>Legacy and Modern Relevance</h2><p>Saint Francis died in 1226 and was canonized just two years later. His legacy continues to inspire millions of people around the world. His message of peace, love for creation, and simple living is more relevant than ever in our materialistic world. Pope Francis chose his name to honor this great saint and to emphasize the Church's commitment to the poor and to environmental protection.</p></article>
