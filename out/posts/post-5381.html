This passage shows that the role of virtues in Catholic life recognizes that virtues are not just nice qualities but essential elements of the Christian life.

The role of virtues in Catholic life recognizes that faith is the virtue by which we believe in God and all that He has revealed.

<h2>The Cardinal Virtues</h2>
<p>The role of virtues in Catholic life includes understanding the four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. These virtues are called cardinal because they are the hinges (cardo in Latin) on which all other moral virtues turn. The role of virtues in Catholic life recognizes that prudence is the virtue that helps us to make good decisions, justice is the virtue that helps us to give to each person what is due to them, fortitude is the virtue that helps us to persevere in doing what is right, and temperance is the virtue that helps us to control our desires and appetites.</p>

<p>This understanding of the cardinal virtues shows that the role of virtues in Catholic life is about practical wisdom and moral strength. The role of virtues in Catholic life recognizes that these virtues help us to live well in this world and to make good moral decisions. This understanding helps us to see that virtues are not just abstract concepts but practical tools for living a good life.</p>

<h2>Virtues and Grace</h2>

The role of virtues in Catholic life recognizes that we cannot develop virtues on our own but need God's help and grace.
