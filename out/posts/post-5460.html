<p>Parents encouraging vocations in their children represents one of the most beautiful and important aspects of Catholic parenting. Hannah's prayer in 1 Samuel 1:27-28, "For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition that I made to him. Therefore I have lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord," provides the foundation for understanding how parents can encourage and support their children in discerning their vocations. This encouragement involves recognizing that every child has a unique vocation from God and that parents have a sacred role in helping their children discover and respond to that call.</p>

<p>When we understand parents encouraging vocations in their children, we recognize that this is not about pushing our children toward a particular path but about helping them discern God's will for their lives. This understanding helps us to see that encouraging vocations is about supporting our children in their journey of faith and helping them discover how God wants them to serve Him.</p>

<h2>Supporting Different Types of Vocations</h2>
