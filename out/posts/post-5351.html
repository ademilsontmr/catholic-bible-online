    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Marriage as Eternal Love</h2>
<p>Marriage as a reflection of God's eternal love in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Romans 8:38-39: "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." This passage shows that marriage as a reflection of God's eternal love is not just a nice concept but is a divine reality where nothing can separate us from God's love. When couples understand marriage as a reflection of God's eternal love, they are not just being romantic but are actively reflecting God's eternal and unbreakable love in their marriage.</p>

This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to reflect God's eternal love.</p>
