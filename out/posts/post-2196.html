    <article><h2>What is Lent?</h2><p>Lent is a 40-day period of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving that prepares us for the celebration of Easter. It begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday. The 40 days represent Jesus' 40 days in the desert, where He fasted and was tempted by the devil. Lent is a time for spiritual renewal and conversion, a chance to turn away from sin and turn toward God.</p><h2>The Three Pillars of Lent</h2><p>Lent is built on three pillars: prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Prayer deepens our relationship with God. Fasting helps us master our desires and grow in self-discipline. Almsgiving helps us love our neighbor and share God's gifts with others. These three practices work together to transform our hearts and prepare us for Easter.</p><h2>Prayer During Lent</h2><p>Lent is a time to intensify our prayer life. This might mean adding extra prayer time, attending daily Mass, praying the Stations of the Cross, or reading Scripture more regularly. Many people find it helpful to pray the Rosary daily during Lent or to participate in parish Lenten programs. The key is to make prayer a priority and to be consistent.</p><h2>Fasting and Abstinence</h2><p>Catholics are required to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday (one full meal and two smaller meals that don't equal a full meal). We are also required to abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and all Fridays during Lent. Beyond these requirements, we can choose additional fasting practices that help us grow spiritually.</p><h2>Almsgiving and Charity</h2><p>Almsgiving means giving to those in need. This might include donating money to charity, volunteering our time, or helping someone in our community. The goal is to be generous with the gifts God has given us and to love our neighbor as ourselves. Almsgiving helps us break free from materialism and grow in love.</p><h2>Lenten Traditions</h2><p>Many Catholic families have Lenten traditions that help them observe this holy season. These might include giving up something (like sweets or television), adding extra prayer time, or participating in parish activities. The Stations of the Cross are a popular Lenten devotion that helps us meditate on Christ's passion.</p><h2>Preparing for Easter</h2><p>The goal of Lent is to prepare our hearts for Easter. Through prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, we die to ourselves and rise with Christ. Lent helps us recognize our need for God's mercy and prepares us to celebrate the joy of the Resurrection. When Easter comes, we should feel renewed and closer to God.</p></article>
