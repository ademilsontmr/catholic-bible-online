When we complete a novena in faith, we experience the truth that God is faithful to His promises and that our prayers are heard.</p><p>This joy is not dependent on whether our specific requests are granted exactly as we hoped, but on the deeper reality that God has been with us throughout the journey.

This joy often brings a sense of peace and contentment that can only come from God.</p><h2>How Completion Brings Joy</h2><p>Completing a novena brings joy in several ways.
