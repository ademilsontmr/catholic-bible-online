    <article><h2>Mary as Our Intercessor</h2><p>Mary, the Mother of God, is our greatest intercessor. At the wedding at Cana, she interceded for the couple who had run out of wine, and Jesus performed His first miracle. This shows us that Mary has a special role in bringing our needs to her Son.</p><p>When we pray the Rosary for others, we are asking Mary to intercede for them. We know that Jesus cannot refuse His mother, and so we turn to her with confidence, knowing that she will bring our petitions to Him.</p><h2>The Rosary as Intercessory Prayer</h2><p>The Rosary is not just a personal prayer, but a powerful intercessory prayer. When we pray it for others, we are offering our meditation on the mysteries of Christ's life for their intentions. Each Hail Mary becomes a prayer for the person we are praying for.</p><p>We can offer each decade of the Rosary for different intentions. For example, we might pray the Joyful Mysteries for someone who is pregnant or expecting a child, the Sorrowful Mysteries for someone who is suffering, or the Glorious Mysteries for someone who has died.</p><h2>Praying the Rosary for Specific Intentions</h2><p>When praying the Rosary for others, it's helpful to be specific about our intentions. Instead of just praying for someone in general, we can pray for specific needs - healing, conversion, peace, guidance, or any other intention.</p><p>We can also pray the Rosary for groups of people - our families, our communities, our Church, or the world. The Rosary is especially powerful when prayed for peace, as Our Lady of Fatima asked us to do.</p><h2>Mary's Promise</h2><p>Our Lady has made many promises to those who pray the Rosary. She promised that those who pray the Rosary will receive special graces, that they will be protected from evil, and that they will have a happy death. These promises apply not just to those who pray the Rosary, but also to those for whom we pray.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Rosary is a beautiful way to pray for others through Mary's intercession. When we pray it with love and devotion, we can be confident that our prayers will be heard and answered according to God's will.</p></article>
