    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Joy in Raising Children</h2>
<p>Joy in raising children together in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Psalm 127:3-5: "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate." This passage shows that joy in raising children together is not just a nice concept but is a divine reality where children are a heritage and reward from the Lord. When couples understand joy in raising children together, they are not just being parents but are actively recognizing children as God's gift and finding joy in raising them together.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that joy in raising children together is not just about being happy parents but is about actively recognizing children as God's gift and finding joy in raising them together. When couples understand this joy, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to find joy in raising children.</p>

<h2>Children as God's Heritage and Reward</h2>
<p>Joy in raising children together recognizes that children are not just human beings but are God's heritage and reward. Just as children are a heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the womb a reward, so too are married couples called to recognize children as God's gift and find joy in raising them together. This joy is not about being easy but is about being grateful and joyful.</p>

<p>When couples understand joy in raising children together, they are not just being parents but are actively recognizing children as God's gift. They are able to recognize children as God's heritage and reward, to find joy in raising children together, to work together in parenting and family life, to grow in love and joy through raising children, and to be examples of joyful parenting to others. This joy becomes a powerful foundation for family life.</p>
