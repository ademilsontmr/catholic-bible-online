    <article><h2>The Beatitudes as a Blueprint for Marriage</h2>
<p>The Beatitudes, as taught by Jesus in Matthew 5:3–10, provide Catholic couples with a blueprint for living a holy and blessed married life. These eight beatitudes are not just individual virtues but are a way of life that couples can live out together. When couples strive to live the Beatitudes in their marriage, they are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

<p>The Beatitudes are: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<h2>Poor in Spirit: Humility in Marriage</h2>
<p>The first beatitude, "Blessed are the poor in spirit," calls couples to live with humility in their marriage. This means recognizing that they are not perfect and that they need God's grace to live their vocation well. It also means being willing to admit when they are wrong, to ask for forgiveness, and to learn from their mistakes.</p>

<p>When couples live with humility, they are better able to communicate effectively, to resolve conflicts, and to grow together. They are also better able to see each other as God sees them and to love each other with the same unconditional love that God has for them. This humility helps couples to build a strong foundation for their marriage.</p>

<h2>Those Who Mourn: Compassion in Marriage</h2>
<p>The second beatitude, "Blessed are those who mourn," calls couples to be compassionate with each other in times of sorrow and difficulty. This means being willing to share each other's burdens, to comfort each other in times of grief, and to support each other through life's challenges.</p>

<p>When couples are compassionate with each other, they create an environment of love and support where they can grow together. They are also better able to empathize with each other's feelings and to provide the comfort and encouragement that each other needs. This compassion helps couples to build a strong and lasting marriage.</p>

<h2>The Meek: Gentleness in Marriage</h2>
<p>The third beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," calls couples to be gentle with each other in their words and actions. This means being patient, kind, and understanding in the way they treat each other. It also means being willing to control their temper and to speak with love and respect.</p>

<h2>Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness: Seeking God's Will</h2>
<p>The fourth beatitude, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness," calls couples to seek God's will in their marriage.
