    <article><h2>What is Refugee and Immigrant Ministry?</h2><p>Refugee and immigrant ministry is the practice of serving and supporting refugees, immigrants, and other newcomers to our communities through prayer, pastoral care, practical assistance, and advocacy, recognizing that all people are created in the image and likeness of God and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The Catholic Church teaches that refugee and immigrant ministry is an important form of service to the poor and marginalized, and that refugees and immigrants are often among the most vulnerable members of society, fleeing violence, persecution, or extreme poverty in search of safety and opportunity. This ministry involves not just providing basic needs or services, but building authentic relationships with newcomers, offering them welcome, support, and the opportunity to grow spiritually. It is about recognizing that God's love and mercy extend to all people, regardless of their nationality, language, or legal status, and that we are called to welcome the stranger as we would welcome Christ Himself. This ministry helps refugees and immigrants understand that they are welcomed and valued members of our communities and that they have important gifts and contributions to offer.</p><p>The Bible provides many examples of God's care for refugees and immigrants, from the Israelites' experience as refugees in Egypt, to Jesus' family fleeing to Egypt to escape persecution, to the many references to God's love for the stranger and the call to practice hospitality. Scripture shows us that God has a special concern for those who are displaced or seeking refuge, and that we are called to welcome and care for them with love and compassion. The Bible also teaches that all people are created in God's image and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality or legal status.</p><h2>Why Pray for Refugee and Immigrant Ministry?</h2><p>Praying for refugee and immigrant ministry is important because it helps us develop the compassion, courage, and wisdom needed to serve refugees and immigrants effectively and to create more welcoming communities.
