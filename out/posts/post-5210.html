    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Prayer Together</h2>
<p>The power of prayer together in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Matthew 18:19: "Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven." This passage shows that when couples pray together, they are not just praying individually but are united in their prayer, and this unity brings special graces and blessings to their marriage.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that prayer together is not just a nice thing to do but is a powerful means of strengthening the marriage bond.
