    <h1>The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: The Baptism of the Lord</h2><p>Jesus stands among sinners at the Jordan, not to be purified but to sanctify the waters for us. The heavens open; the Spirit descends; the Father declares, “You are my beloved Son.”</p><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p>Christ’s baptism reveals solidarity and mission. He foreshadows the Paschal Mystery: descent (death) and rising (new life). He makes the waters a gateway into divine life.</p><h2>Trinitarian Epiphany</h2><p>The Father’s voice, the Son’s obedience, and the Spirit’s anointing reveal God as communion. Our baptism makes us beloved sons and daughters in the Son.</p><h2>Living Our Baptism</h2><ul><li>Priestly: offer your daily work as spiritual worship.</li><li>Prophetic: speak truth in charity.</li><li>Royal: govern your passions and defend the vulnerable.</li></ul><h2>Practices</h2><p>Renew your baptismal promises; mark your baptism date; use holy water; seek reconciliation often; hear the Father’s voice over every other.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Father of mercies, renew in us the grace of our baptism. Make us faithful witnesses of your belovedness in the world. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
