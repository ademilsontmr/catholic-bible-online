Through fasting, we learn to find the right balance between satisfying our needs and practicing self-denial.</p><h2>Fasting as a Tool for Overcoming Vices</h2><p>Fasting can be a powerful tool for overcoming particular vices or bad habits. When we fast, we are practicing the same kind of self-control needed to resist other temptations. Many people have found that regular fasting helps them overcome addictions, develop better eating habits, and resist other forms of self-indulgence.</p><h2>Conclusion: How Fasting Helps Catholics Grow in Self-Discipline</h2><p>How fasting helps Catholics grow in self-discipline provides a profound framework for understanding how fasting involves recognizing how fasting strengthens our will.
