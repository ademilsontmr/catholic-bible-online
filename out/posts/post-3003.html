    <article><h2>Marriage as a Sacred Covenant</h2><p>Catholic teaching sees marriage as a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, established by God and elevated by Christ to the dignity of a sacrament. Catholic tradition understands marriage as not just a human contract but a divine institution that reflects God's love for His people. This sacrament makes present Christ's love for the Church and provides the grace needed for couples to live their vocation faithfully. Marriage is a lifelong commitment that calls couples to grow in love and holiness together.</p><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Marriage</h2><p>The Bible provides the foundation for understanding marriage as a divine institution. Catholic tradition sees God's creation of man and woman as establishing the pattern for marriage as a lifelong union. Jesus' teaching on marriage emphasizes its permanence and sacredness, showing that it is not to be dissolved by human decision. St. Paul's teaching on marriage as reflecting Christ's love for the Church shows the sacramental nature of this union. This biblical foundation shows that marriage is part of God's plan for human flourishing.</p><h2>The Purposes of Marriage</h2><p>Catholic teaching identifies three essential purposes of marriage: the good of the spouses, the procreation and education of children, and the building up of the Church and society. Catholic tradition sees these purposes as interconnected and essential for understanding the nature of marriage. The good of the spouses includes their mutual support and growth in holiness. The procreation and education of children shows that marriage is open to new life. The building up of the Church and society shows that marriage serves the common good.</p><h2>The Properties of Marriage</h2><p>Catholic teaching identifies two essential properties of marriage: unity and indissolubility. Catholic tradition sees these properties as essential for the sacrament's integrity and effectiveness. Unity means that marriage is an exclusive relationship between one man and one woman. Indissolubility means that marriage is a lifelong commitment that cannot be dissolved by human decision. These properties show that marriage is not a temporary arrangement but a permanent covenant.</p><h2>The Grace of the Sacrament</h2><p>Marriage as a sacrament provides the grace needed for couples to live their vocation faithfully. Catholic tradition sees this grace as essential for helping couples grow in love and holiness. The sacrament gives couples the strength to overcome difficulties and to remain faithful to their commitment. This grace also helps couples to serve each other and their children with love and generosity. Through the sacrament, couples receive the divine assistance needed for their mission.</p><h2>Marriage and Family Life</h2><p>Marriage is the foundation of family life, providing the context for the procreation and education of children. Catholic tradition sees the family as the domestic church, where children learn about God and the faith. Marriage provides the stable and loving environment needed for children to grow and develop. This understanding shows that marriage is not just about the couple but about building a family that serves God and society.</p><h2>Contemporary Applications</h2><p>Understanding marriage as a sacrament helps modern couples appreciate the sacredness and importance of their commitment. This understanding shows that marriage is not just a social institution but a divine calling. The sacrament provides couples with the grace and guidance they need to live their vocation faithfully. This understanding also helps couples explain and defend the Catholic understanding of marriage to others.</p><h2>Integration with Catholic Life</h2><p>Marriage is integrated into every aspect of Catholic life, providing the foundation for family life and the building up of the Church. Catholic tradition emphasizes that marriage should be lived as a vocation and a path to holiness. This integration ensures that couples see their marriage as part of their spiritual journey and their service to God. Marriage provides the context for living out the Christian life in a unique and important way.</p></article>
