    <article><h2>Introduction: The Baptismal Promises</h2><p>What is the meaning of the baptismal promises? This question addresses one of the most important aspects of the sacrament of baptism. Joshua 24:15 and Romans 6:11 provide the biblical foundation for this understanding. Joshua 24:15 states: 'Now if you are unwilling to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.' Romans 6:11 teaches: 'So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.' These verses reveal the profound meaning of the promises we make at baptism.</p><p>The Catholic Church teaches that the baptismal promises are not just ritual words but are serious commitments that we make to God and to the Church. Through these promises, we commit ourselves to serve the Lord, to reject sin and the devil, and to live as faithful disciples of Christ. These promises are the foundation of our Christian life and guide us in our journey of faith.</p><h2>The Context of Joshua 24:15</h2><p>To understand the meaning of the baptismal promises, we must examine the context of Joshua 24:15. Joshua is addressing the people of Israel and calling them to make a choice about whom they will serve. The verse reads: 'Now if you are unwilling to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.'</p><p>This verse shows that serving the Lord is a choice that we must make, and that this choice involves rejecting other gods and committing ourselves to serve the Lord alone. This choice is not just a one-time decision but is a commitment that affects every aspect of our lives. The baptismal promises are our way of making this choice and committing ourselves to serve the Lord.</p><p>This context shows that the baptismal promises involve a choice to serve the Lord and to reject all other gods.</p><h2>The Context of Romans 6:11</h2><p>To understand the meaning of the baptismal promises, we must also examine Romans 6:11. Saint Paul is writing about the way baptism changes our relationship with sin. The verse reads: 'So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.'</p><p>This verse shows that through baptism, we are called to consider ourselves dead to sin and alive to God. This change in our relationship with sin is not just symbolic but is a real spiritual reality that affects how we live our lives. The baptismal promises are our way of committing ourselves to this new way of life.</p><p>This context shows that the baptismal promises involve a commitment to live as people who are dead to sin and alive to God.</p><h2>The Choice to Serve the Lord</h2><p>What is the meaning of the baptismal promises?
