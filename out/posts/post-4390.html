This location served as a physical reminder of these events and helped to preserve the memory of Judas's betrayal and its consequences.</p><p>Understanding what happened to the Field of Blood helps us appreciate the historical and symbolic significance of this location and the various ways in which it was used and understood in the early Church.</p><h2>The Biblical Account of the Field of Blood</h2><p>The Bible provides two different accounts of the Field of Blood, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Book of Acts, which differ in some details but both emphasize the significance of this location. Understanding these biblical accounts helps us appreciate the ways in which the early Church understood and interpreted this location and the various meanings that were attached to it.</p><p>According to Matthew's account in Matthew 27:3-10, Judas was seized with remorse after betraying Jesus and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying that he had sinned by betraying innocent blood. The chief priests and elders refused to take the money back, saying that it was blood money and that it was not lawful to put it into the treasury. Judas then threw the thirty pieces of silver into the temple and went away and hanged himself. The chief priests and elders then used the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners, which Matthew notes was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 11:12-13.</p><p>According to Acts' account in Acts 1:18-19, Judas bought a field with the reward of his wickedness and fell headlong, bursting open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out. The field that Judas bought became known as the Field of Blood, or Akeldama in Aramaic. This account suggests that Judas himself used the money to buy the field, rather than the chief priests and elders using the money to buy the field.</p><p>Both accounts emphasize that the field became known as the Field of Blood, which suggests that this name was significant and that it served as a reminder of the blood that was shed as a result of Judas's betrayal. This name suggests that the field was associated with death and judgment and that it served as a symbol of the consequences of betrayal and sin.</p><p>Both accounts also emphasize that the field was used as a burial place, which suggests that it served a practical purpose in addition to its symbolic significance.

This location suggests that the Field of Blood was not a prestigious or desirable location but was rather a place that was associated with death, judgment, and impurity.</p><p>The Field of Blood has also been identified with a location near the traditional site of Judas's suicide, which was believed to be on the southern slope of the Mount of Olives.
