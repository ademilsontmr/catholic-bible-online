    <h1>The Feast of Christ the King</h1>
    <p><em>2025-02-02</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The Feast of Christ the King crowns the liturgical year with a bold confession: Jesus is Lord of history and the human heart. His crown is of thorns, his throne the Cross, his scepter mercy. He reigns not by domination but by self-giving love.</p><h2>Gospel Vision</h2><p>Before Pilate, Jesus declares, “My kingdom is not of this world” (Jn 18). Not meaning otherworldly escape, but a different logic: truth over propaganda, service over power, holiness over cynicism. The Beatitudes name the culture of his kingdom.</p><h2>Allegiance and Mission</h2><ul><li><strong>Worship:</strong> Place Christ at the center—Sunday Mass, adoration, daily prayer.</li><li><strong>Conscience:</strong> Let the King form your judgments; truth is not negotiated by polls.</li><li><strong>Charity:</strong> Recognize Christ in the least; the final judgment (Mt 25) measures love.</li></ul><h2>Public Life</h2><p>Christ’s kingship inspires civic virtue: honesty, defense of life, care for the poor, religious freedom. Christians engage without bitterness, hopeful and courageous.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Jesus, King of the Universe, reign in us. Make our homes, work, and society reflect your kingdom of truth and peace. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
