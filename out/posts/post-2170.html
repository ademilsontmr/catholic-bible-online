    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Early Life and Vocation</h2><p>Saint Thérèse of Lisieux was born Marie-Françoise-Thérèse Martin on January 2, 1873, in Alençon, France. From an early age, she showed remarkable spiritual sensitivity and a deep desire to serve God. After losing her mother at age four, Thérèse was raised by her father and older sisters in a deeply religious household. At age 15, she entered the Carmelite convent in Lisieux, where she would spend the rest of her short but impactful life.</p><h2>The Little Way</h2><p>Thérèse developed what she called 'The Little Way' - a path to holiness through small, everyday acts of love and sacrifice. She believed that holiness wasn't about doing great deeds, but about doing ordinary things with extraordinary love. This revolutionary approach made sanctity accessible to everyone, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.</p><h2>Spiritual Childhood</h2><p>Thérèse embraced spiritual childhood, seeing herself as a little child in God's arms. She wrote, 'I am too little to perform great actions, and my own folly is this: to trust that Your love will accept me as a victim.' This childlike trust in God's mercy became the foundation of her spirituality and continues to inspire millions today.</p><h2>Her Writings and Legacy</h2><p>Thérèse's autobiography, 'Story of a Soul,' was published after her death and became one of the most influential spiritual books of the 20th century. Her simple yet profound insights into prayer, suffering, and God's love have touched countless hearts. Pope Pius XI called her 'the greatest saint of modern times.'</p><h2>Suffering and Trust</h2><p>Despite her young age, Thérèse experienced deep suffering, including the death of her father and her own battle with tuberculosis. Through it all, she maintained her trust in God's love and offered her sufferings for the salvation of souls. Her example shows us how to find meaning in suffering through love.</p><h2>Patroness of Missions</h2><p>Though Thérèse never left her convent, she was named patroness of missions by Pope Pius XI. She understood that prayer and sacrifice could reach souls around the world. Her intercession continues to bring countless people closer to God, proving that love knows no boundaries.</p><h2>Feast Day and Devotion</h2><p>Saint Thérèse's feast day is celebrated on October 1st. She is the patron saint of missions, florists, and those suffering from tuberculosis. Many people pray to her for help with impossible causes, and she is known for sending roses as a sign of her intercession. Her 'Little Way' remains a powerful path to holiness for people of all ages and circumstances.</p></article>
