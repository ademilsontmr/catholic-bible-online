    <article><h2>Early Life and Vocation</h2><p>Saint Padre Pio was born Francesco Forgione in 1887 in Pietrelcina, Italy. From an early age, he showed great piety and a desire for religious life. He entered the Capuchin Order at the age of 15 and was ordained a priest in 1910. Padre Pio spent most of his life at the monastery of San Giovanni Rotondo, where he became known for his holiness and miraculous gifts.</p><h2>The Stigmata</h2><p>In 1918, Padre Pio received the stigmata - the wounds of Christ's crucifixion appeared on his hands, feet, and side. These wounds caused him great pain and bled continuously. Medical examinations confirmed that the wounds were real and could not be explained by natural causes. The stigmata remained with Padre Pio for 50 years, until his death.</p><h2>Miraculous Gifts</h2><p>Padre Pio was blessed with many spiritual gifts, including the ability to read souls, bilocation (being in two places at once), and the gift of healing. He could often tell people their sins before they confessed them, and many people reported being healed through his prayers. His intercession continues to bring about miracles today.</p><h2>Spiritual Direction</h2><p>Padre Pio was a sought-after spiritual director. People from all over the world came to him for advice and confession. He was known for his wisdom, compassion, and ability to help people grow in holiness. His spiritual counsel was always practical and grounded in Catholic teaching.</p><h2>Suffering and Persecution</h2><p>Padre Pio suffered greatly throughout his life, both physically from the stigmata and spiritually from persecution within the Church. Some Church authorities were suspicious of his gifts and tried to limit his ministry. Despite these difficulties, Padre Pio remained faithful to God and the Church.</p><h2>Legacy and Canonization</h2><p>Padre Pio died in 1968 and was canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II. His legacy continues to inspire millions of people around the world. The hospital he founded, the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, continues to serve the sick and poor. His shrine in San Giovanni Rotondo is one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in the world.</p><h2>Prayers to Padre Pio</h2><p>Many people pray to Padre Pio for healing, spiritual guidance, and help with difficult situations. His famous prayer is: 'Stay with me, Lord, for it is necessary to have You present so that I do not forget You. You know how easily I abandon You. Stay with me, Lord, because I am weak and I need Your strength, that I may not fall so often.'</p></article>
