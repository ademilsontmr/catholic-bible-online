    <p><em>2024-12-21</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Citizenship as Building Foundation</h2><p>Catholic citizenship and the call to build a better America is about recognizing that Catholic citizenship is not just a political status or a collection of civic duties, but a powerful calling to work for the transformation and improvement of American society through its commitment to human dignity, solidarity, and the common good. When American Catholics respond to this call effectively, they're not just fulfilling civic obligations or creating religious atmospheres, but actively participating in God's work of building a better American society where all citizens can flourish and find the resources they need to live dignified and meaningful lives. This building call is not about seeking personal advantage or about creating religious enclaves, but about using Catholic citizenship to guide work for improvement and to help build a society that reflects the values of the Gospel.</p><p>Throughout American history, Catholic citizenship has played a vital role in American society, helping to guide various forms of civic participation and community building that have contributed to the moral and spiritual character of the nation. From the early Catholic settlers who worked to build schools, hospitals, and other community institutions to the modern Catholic citizens who continue to serve American society in various ways, Catholic citizenship has been a powerful force for good in American life. When American Catholics respond to this call effectively, they can help to transform American society and to create a better nation.</p><h2>How Catholic Citizenship Calls Americans to Build a Better America</h2><p>Catholic citizenship calls Americans to build a better America in several important ways. First, it provides a moral and spiritual foundation that helps American Catholics to understand their responsibility to work for the common good and to use their gifts and talents to build a better society. Second, it offers principles and values that can guide work for improvement, such as the preferential option for the poor, the principle of solidarity, and the call to work for the common good. Third, it helps American Catholics to understand that true improvement comes not from seeking personal advantage but from working together to build a society where all people can flourish and contribute to the common good. Fourth, it provides spiritual resources and practices that can help people to find strength and courage in their work for improvement, and to persevere even when faced with various challenges and difficulties. Fifth, it bears witness to the truth that improvement work is not just a civic goal but a moral and spiritual imperative that flows from our relationship with God.</p><h2>Conclusion: Citizenship as Building Mission</h2><p>Catholic citizenship and the call to build a better America is ultimately about recognizing our calling to respond to this call effectively and to use our citizenship to help build a better American society, and about helping American Catholics to understand that true improvement comes not from seeking personal advantage but from working together to build a society that reflects the values of the Gospel and serves the common good. When American Catholics respond to this call effectively, they're not just fulfilling civic obligations or creating religious atmospheres, but actively participating in God's work of building a better American society. This building call becomes a powerful tool for evangelization and social transformation, helping American Catholics to work together for a society that reflects the values of the Gospel and serves the common good.</p><h2>Prayer for Catholic Citizenship</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help American Catholics to respond effectively to the call to build a better America, recognizing that You call us to work together for improvement and to build a better society.
