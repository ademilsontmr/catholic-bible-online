    <article><h2>Origin of the Divine Mercy Chaplet</h2><p>The Divine Mercy Chaplet was given to Saint Faustina Kowalska by Jesus Himself in the 1930s. Jesus told her that this prayer would be a powerful means of obtaining mercy for the whole world. The chaplet uses ordinary rosary beads but has its own unique prayers and structure.</p><h2>Saint Faustina's Vision</h2><p>Saint Faustina was a Polish nun who received numerous visions of Jesus. In these visions, Jesus appeared with rays of mercy flowing from His heart and asked her to spread devotion to His Divine Mercy. He promised that those who would recite this chaplet would receive great mercy at the hour of death.</p><h2>When to Pray the Chaplet</h2><p>The Divine Mercy Chaplet can be prayed at any time, but it's especially powerful when prayed at 3:00 PM, the hour of Jesus' death. Many people pray it daily as part of their prayer routine. It's particularly appropriate during the Divine Mercy Novena and on Divine Mercy Sunday.</p><h2>Required Prayers</h2><p>The chaplet begins with the Sign of the Cross and an opening prayer. On the Our Father beads, you pray: 'Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.' On the Hail Mary beads, you pray: 'For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.'</p><h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Begin with the Sign of the Cross. Say the opening prayer once. On the first large bead, say the Our Father. On the second large bead, say the Hail Mary. On the third large bead, say the Apostles' Creed. On the large bead before each decade, say the Eternal Father prayer. On each of the ten small beads, say the 'For the sake of His sorrowful Passion' prayer. After each decade, say the Glory Be and the closing prayer.</p><h2>The 3 O'Clock Hour</h2><p>Jesus specifically asked that the chaplet be prayed at 3:00 PM, the hour of His death. At this hour, He said, 'I will refuse nothing to the soul that makes a request of Me in virtue of My Passion.' Even if you can't pray the full chaplet at 3:00 PM, you can say a brief prayer asking for God's mercy.</p><h2>Spiritual Benefits and Promises</h2><p>Jesus promised that those who pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet would receive great mercy at the hour of death. The chaplet brings peace to troubled hearts, helps us trust in God's mercy, and reminds us of the infinite love Jesus has for each of us. It's a powerful prayer for the conversion of sinners and the salvation of souls.</p></article>
