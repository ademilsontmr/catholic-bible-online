    <article><h2>The Role of Prophets in the Old Testament: God's Messengers to His People</h2><p>The prophets of the Old Testament played a crucial role in God's plan of salvation. They were not fortune-tellers or predictors of random future events, but were God's chosen messengers who spoke His word to His people. The prophets called the people back to faithfulness to God, warned them about the consequences of sin, and prepared the way for the coming of the Messiah. Their messages were often challenging and uncomfortable, but they were essential for maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people.</p><p>The prophetic books of the Old Testament contain some of the most beautiful and powerful literature in the Bible. The prophets spoke with passion and conviction, using vivid imagery and powerful language to convey God's message.

Through their words and actions, the prophets helped to shape the religious and moral consciousness of Israel and prepared the way for the coming of Jesus Christ.</p><h2>What is a Prophet?</h2><p>A prophet is a person called by God to speak His word to His people:</p><p><strong>Divine Calling:</strong> Prophets are not self-appointed but are called by God for a specific mission.
