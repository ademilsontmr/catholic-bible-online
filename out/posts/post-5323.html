    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Marriage as Faith Journey</h2>
<p>Marriage as a journey of faith in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Hebrews 11:1: "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This passage shows that marriage as a journey of faith is not just a nice concept but is a reality where couples walk together in faith, trusting in God's promises and His plan for their relationship. When couples understand marriage as a journey of faith, they are not just being religious but are actively walking together in faith and trusting in God's guidance for their marriage.</p>

When couples understand this journey, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to walk in faith together.</p>

<h2>Faith Journey as Trust in God's Plan</h2>
<p>Marriage as a journey of faith recognizes that faith is not just a belief but is an active trust in God's plan and promises for the marriage. Just as faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen, so too is marriage a journey where couples trust in God's plan even when they cannot see the full picture. This journey is not about being certain but is about being trusting.</p>

This journey becomes a powerful expression of their faith and trust.</p>
