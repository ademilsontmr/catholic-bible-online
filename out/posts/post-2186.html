    <p><em>undefined</em></p>
    <article><h2>Early Life and Vocation</h2><p>Saint Therese of Lisieux was born in 1873 in France. From an early age, she felt called to religious life and entered the Carmelite convent at the age of 15. Though her life was short - she died at 24 - her spiritual insights have made her one of the most beloved saints in the Church. She is known as 'The Little Flower' and is a Doctor of the Church.</p><h2>The Little Way Explained</h2><p>The 'Little Way' is Therese's approach to holiness through small, everyday acts of love and sacrifice. She realized that she couldn't do great deeds like the martyrs or missionaries, but she could offer small sacrifices and acts of love to God. She compared herself to a little flower that gives its fragrance to God without being noticed.</p><h2>Spiritual Childhood</h2><p>Therese emphasized the importance of spiritual childhood - approaching God with the trust and simplicity of a child. She wrote, 'I want to be a saint, but I feel my helplessness. I ask you, O my God, to be Yourself my holiness.' This childlike trust in God's mercy and love is at the heart of her spirituality.</p><h2>Suffering and Trust</h2><p>Therese suffered greatly during her short life, both physically and spiritually. She experienced a dark night of the soul and died of tuberculosis. Yet through it all, she maintained her trust in God's love. She wrote, 'Everything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our Father's love.'</p><h2>Her Writings and Teachings</h2><p>Therese's autobiography, 'Story of a Soul,' has inspired millions of people. In it, she shares her spiritual journey and her Little Way. She also wrote poems and plays. Her writings are characterized by their simplicity, honesty, and deep love for God. They continue to speak to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p><h2>Patroness of Missions</h2><p>Though Therese never left her convent, she is the patroness of missions. She understood that prayer and sacrifice could support the work of missionaries around the world. She wrote, 'I will spend my heaven doing good on earth.' Her intercession is credited with many miracles and conversions.</p><h2>Applying the Little Way Today</h2><p>Therese's Little Way is accessible to everyone. We can practice it by offering small sacrifices, being patient with others, doing our daily duties with love, and trusting in God's mercy. Her message is especially relevant in our busy world, where we often feel we need to do great things to be holy.</p></article>
