I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save." This passage shows that God's love and faithfulness extend throughout our entire lives, including into old age. When couples grow old together, they are not just aging but are experiencing the beauty and wisdom that comes from a lifetime of love and faithfulness.</p>
