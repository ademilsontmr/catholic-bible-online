    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Patience in Parenting</h2>
<p>Patience in parenting in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Psalm 127:3: "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward." This passage shows that children are not just responsibilities to manage but are precious gifts from God that require patience, love, and care. When couples practice patience in parenting, they are not just being good parents but are actively participating in God's work of raising the children He has entrusted to them.</p>

When couples practice patience in parenting, they are not just improving their family but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation as parents. This patience is not about being perfect but is about being willing to be patient with God's gifts.</p>
