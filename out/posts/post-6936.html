    <h1>Holiness Through Hospitality and Welcoming Strangers</h1>
    <p><em>2024-12-20</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Hospitality as Divine Command</h2><p>Holiness through hospitality and welcoming strangers is about recognizing that hospitality is not just a social nicety or a cultural custom, but a divine command that God has given us for our sanctification and the salvation of our souls. Jesus tells us that whatever we do for the least of our brothers and sisters, we do for Him, and this includes welcoming strangers and showing them hospitality. When we practice hospitality, we're not just being polite or generous, but encountering Christ Himself in the person of the stranger and growing in holiness through this encounter.</p><p>Hospitality involves more than just providing food and shelter to guests, though these are important aspects. True hospitality means welcoming others with open hearts and open homes, making them feel valued and loved, and creating an environment where they can experience God's love through our care and concern. This hospitality is not limited to our homes, but extends to our workplaces, our parishes, and all the places where we encounter others. It's about creating spaces where people feel welcome, accepted, and loved.</p><h2>The Spiritual Benefits of Hospitality</h2><p>Practicing hospitality provides numerous opportunities for spiritual growth. It teaches us generosity as we share what we have with others. It teaches us humility as we put others' needs before our own and recognize that everything we have is a gift from God. It teaches us compassion as we learn to see the world through others' eyes and to understand their needs and concerns. It teaches us gratitude as we become more aware of our own blessings and the privilege of being able to help others.</p><h2>Conclusion: Hospitality as Worship</h2><p>Hospitality and welcoming strangers lead to holiness because they help us to see Christ in every person we encounter and to serve Him through our care for others. When we practice hospitality with love and generosity, we're not just being good hosts, but participating in God's work of love and redemption in the world. We become more generous, more compassionate, more humble, and more holy. Our homes and our hearts become places where others can experience God's love and mercy.</p><h2>Prayer for Hospitality</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to practice hospitality and to welcome strangers with open hearts and open homes. Give us the grace to see You in every person we encounter and to serve You through our care for others. May our hospitality become a witness to Your love and help us grow in holiness. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
