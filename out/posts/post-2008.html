    <article><h2>What is Baptism Preparation?</h2><p>Baptism preparation is the spiritual practice of preparing for the Sacrament of Baptism, which is the gateway to all other sacraments and the beginning of new life in Christ.

Preparation for Baptism involves understanding the meaning and significance of the sacrament, developing a prayerful disposition, and preparing to live as a faithful disciple of Christ. This preparation is important for both adults preparing for Baptism and for parents preparing their children for the sacrament, as it helps ensure that the sacrament is received with the right disposition and understanding.</p><p>The Bible provides many examples of preparation for important spiritual events, from John the Baptist calling people to prepare for the coming of the Messiah, to the early Christians preparing for Baptism through instruction and prayer, to Jesus' own preparation for His ministry through prayer and fasting.
