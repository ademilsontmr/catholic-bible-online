<h2>Introduction: The Immaculate Conception</h2>
<p>The Immaculate Conception proclaims that the Blessed Virgin Mary, from the first instant of her conception, by a singular grace of God and in view of the merits of Christ, was preserved immune from original sin. This dogma reveals God’s initiative and Mary’s unique role in salvation history.</p>
<h2>Biblical Roots and Tradition</h2>
<p><strong>Luke 1:28</strong>—“full of grace”—hints at a singular holiness. The protoevangelium (<strong>Gen 3:15</strong>) foreshadows the Woman whose offspring conquers the serpent. The Church’s tradition gradually recognized Mary’s pristine holiness, defined dogmatically by Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Christ-centered:</strong> Mary’s privilege flows from Christ’s redeeming work, applied preemptively.</li>
  <li><strong>Hope for us:</strong> Her holiness shows God’s plan to restore humanity.</li>
  <li><strong>Discipleship:</strong> Mary models receptivity, humility, and obedience to grace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Living the Mystery</h2>
<p>Imitate Mary’s “yes”; cultivate purity of heart; receive the sacraments; entrust your life to her maternal care.</p>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<blockquote><p>O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. Amen.</p></blockquote>
