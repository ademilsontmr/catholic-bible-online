    <article><h2>Introduction: Mary's Royal Dignity and Universal Queenship</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth emphasizes her royal dignity that flows from her divine motherhood while recognizing that Mary's queenship serves the mission of Christ the King and enables her to exercise maternal care and intercession for all creation through her unique participation in Christ's royal authority and salvific work. The Church's understanding of Mary's queenship reflects her exalted position in the hierarchy of creation while demonstrating that her royal dignity serves not her own glory but the glory of God and the salvation of humanity through her continuous intercession and maternal guidance. Mary's queenship reveals both her unique privileges and her service to God's kingdom while inspiring all believers to recognize her authority and seek her protection and guidance in their journey toward eternal life with God through faithful discipleship and cooperation with divine grace.</p><h2>Biblical and Theological Foundations</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary's queenship finds its foundation in Sacred Scripture and theological tradition that recognizes Mary's unique role in salvation history while identifying her with the Queen Mother of the Davidic kingdom and the Woman clothed with the sun in the Book of Revelation who represents the Church and the People of God. The Church's understanding of Mary's royal dignity develops from her divine motherhood and her unique participation in Christ's redemptive work while recognizing that her queenship serves the establishment of God's kingdom and the salvation of all humanity. This biblical and theological foundation demonstrates how Mary's queenship serves both the glory of Christ and the mission of the Church while showing that honoring Mary as Queen leads to deeper understanding of Christ's kingship and more faithful participation in the work of salvation that God accomplishes through the Church that Mary serves as Mother and Queen.</p><h2>Mary's Coronation and Heavenly Glory</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on Mary's queenship emphasize her coronation in heaven that completes her earthly mission and establishes her royal authority over all creation while recognizing that Mary's heavenly coronation represents the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan for her unique vocation as Mother of God and Mother of the Church. The Church teaches that Mary's coronation as Queen flows from her assumption into heaven and represents her complete participation in Christ's victory over sin and death while enabling her to exercise royal care and protection over all believers. This coronation dimension demonstrates how Mary's queenship serves both her personal glorification and the benefit of all creation while showing that Mary's royal authority enables her to provide effective protection and guidance for all who seek her maternal care and intercession in their struggles against sin and their journey toward eternal life with God through faithful following of Christ.</p><h2>Mary's Maternal Queenship and Intercession</h2><p>Catholic teaching on Mary's queenship includes attention to her maternal character that distinguishes her royal authority from earthly kingship while recognizing that Mary exercises her queenship through maternal love, care, and intercession rather than through power or domination over her subjects who are her spiritual children. The Church teaches that Mary's queenship serves the needs of believers and the mission of salvation while her royal authority enables her to provide special protection and assistance to all who invoke her name and seek her maternal guidance. This maternal dimension demonstrates how Mary's queenship serves not her own interests but the welfare of all creation while showing that Mary's royal dignity enables her to serve as advocate and protector for all believers who trust in her maternal care and powerful intercession that flows from her intimate union with Christ and her perfect cooperation with God's salvific plan for humanity.</p><h2>Devotion to Mary as Queen</h2><p>Catholic perspectives on Mary's queenship emphasize appropriate devotion and veneration while promoting understanding of Mary's royal dignity as inspiration for all believers to honor her authority and seek her protection through prayer, liturgical celebration, and imitation of her virtues that led to her royal glorification. The Church encourages devotion to Mary as Queen through various forms of prayer and worship that serve both individual spiritual growth and community celebration while recognizing that honoring Mary's queenship leads to deeper faith in Christ and more faithful participation in the life of the Church. This devotional dimension demonstrates how recognition of Mary's queenship enriches Christian spiritual life while serving as a source of hope and protection for all believers who face the challenges of earthly life and seek the support of their heavenly Queen who understands their struggles and provides maternal care and powerful intercession that enables them to persevere in faith and reach their ultimate destiny of eternal life with God through faithful following of Christ who crowned his Mother as Queen of Heaven and Earth to serve the salvation of all humanity through her maternal love and royal protection that extends to all who honor her queenship and seek her maternal guidance in their journey toward eternal union with the Blessed Trinity.</p></article>
