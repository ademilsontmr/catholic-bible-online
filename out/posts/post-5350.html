    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Hope for Struggling Marriages</h2>
<p>Hope for struggling marriages in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Jeremiah 29:11: "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope." This passage shows that hope for struggling marriages is not just a nice concept but is a divine promise where God has plans for welfare and a future with hope.

When couples understand this hope, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to trust in God's plans.</p>
