    <article><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Saint Joseph's chastity is a beautiful example of how this virtue can be lived with dignity and love. His relationship with the Blessed Virgin Mary was marked by purity, respect, and deep spiritual love.</p><h2>Chastity as Love</h2><p>Joseph's chastity was not a cold or negative virtue, but a positive expression of love. He loved Mary with a pure, selfless love that put her dignity and God's plan above his own desires.</p><h2>Respect for Mary's Vocation</h2><p>Joseph understood that Mary was called to a unique vocation as the Mother of God. His chastity was a sign of his respect for her divine calling and his willingness to support her in her mission.</p><h2>Chastity in Marriage</h2><p>Joseph shows us that chastity can be lived even within marriage. His relationship with Mary was a model of how spouses can love each other with purity and respect, putting God at the center of their love.</p><h2>Teaching Us Chastity</h2><p>Saint Joseph teaches us that chastity is not about repression, but about ordering our love according to God's plan. It's about loving others with respect and dignity.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>Saint Joseph, model of chastity, help us to love others with purity and respect. Teach us to see the dignity of every person and to order our relationships according to God's will. Amen.</p></blockquote></article>
