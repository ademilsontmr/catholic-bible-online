    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Honesty</h2>
<p>The virtue of honesty in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Proverbs 12:22: "Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight."

<h2>Honesty as a Foundation of Trust</h2>
<p>Honesty in Catholic marriage is the foundation upon which trust is built. Without honesty, it is impossible to build a relationship that is truly intimate and loving.

<h2>Honesty and Communication</h2>

<h2>Honesty and the Mission of Marriage</h2>
<p>Honesty in marriage is essential for fulfilling the mission of marriage. When couples practice honesty, they are better able to serve God and others through their relationship. They are also better able to be witnesses to God's truth and faithfulness in the world.</p>
