    <article><h2>Who is St. Peregrine?</h2><p>Saint Peregrine Laziosi, also known as St. Peregrine of Forlì, is the patron saint of cancer patients, those suffering from cancer, and those seeking healing from serious illnesses. Born in 1260 in Forlì, Italy, St. Peregrine lived a life of deep faith and devotion to God, and his own miraculous healing from cancer makes him a powerful intercessor for those facing similar challenges.</p><p>St. Peregrine's story is particularly inspiring for cancer patients because he himself suffered from cancer in his leg, which was so severe that doctors recommended amputation. However, through his deep prayer and trust in God, he experienced a miraculous healing the night before the scheduled surgery. This miracle, combined with his life of holiness and service to others, led to his canonization and his designation as the patron saint of cancer patients.</p><p>His feast day is celebrated on May 1st, and he is especially venerated by those seeking healing from cancer and other serious illnesses.</p><h2>Why Pray the Novena to St. Peregrine?</h2><p>The novena to St. Peregrine is particularly powerful for cancer patients and their families for several reasons:</p><h3>His Personal Experience</h3><p>St. Peregrine personally experienced the pain and suffering of cancer, making him uniquely qualified to understand and intercede for those facing similar challenges.</p><h3>Miraculous Healing</h3><p>His own miraculous healing from cancer demonstrates God's power to work miracles and gives hope to those seeking healing.</p><h3>Spiritual Strength</h3><p>The novena helps cancer patients and their families find spiritual strength, peace, and hope during difficult times.</p><h3>Community Support</h3><p>Praying the novena connects cancer patients to a larger community of believers who are also praying for healing and strength.</p><h3>Trust in God's Plan</h3><p>The novena helps develop trust in God's plan, even when that plan includes suffering and illness.</p><h2>Biblical Foundation for Healing</h2><p>The Bible contains many passages that speak to God's healing power and His care for the sick. These verses provide comfort and hope for cancer patients:</p><h3>Psalm 103:2-3</h3><p>"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases." This verse reminds us that God is the ultimate healer and that He has the power to heal all diseases.</p><h3>Jeremiah 17:14</h3><p>"Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise." This prayer of Jeremiah can be our own prayer when facing illness.</p><h3>James 5:14-15</h3><p>"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up." This passage shows the power of prayer and the importance of community support.</p><h3>Matthew 8:17</h3><p>"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: 'He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.'" Jesus took upon Himself our sufferings and illnesses, showing His deep compassion for the sick.</p><h2>The Novena Structure</h2><p>The novena to St. Peregrine is prayed for nine consecutive days. Each day includes:</p><h3>Opening Prayer (Pray each day)</h3><p>O great St. Peregrine, you have been called "The Mighty," "The Wonder-Worker" because of the numerous miracles which you have obtained from God for those who have had recourse to you. For so many years you bore in your own flesh this cancerous disease that destroys the very fiber of our being, and who had recourse to the source of all grace when the power of man could do no more. You were favored with the vision of Jesus coming down from His Cross to heal your affliction. Ask of God and Our Lady, the cure of the sick whom we entrust to you.</p><p>Aided in this way by your powerful intercession, we shall sing to God, now and for all eternity, a song of gratitude for His great goodness and mercy.
