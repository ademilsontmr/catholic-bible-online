    <article><h2>Helping Children Understand God's Mercy</h2><p>Helping children understand God's mercy is not just about explaining theological concepts but about helping them experience and trust in God's loving forgiveness, compassion, and willingness to forgive us when we make mistakes. Learning how to help children understand God's mercy helps you recognize that this is an important aspect of helping children develop a healthy relationship with God.

They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.'
