    <h1>The Importance of Intention in a Novena</h1>
    <p><em>2024-12-19</em></p>
    <article><h2>Introduction: Intention as Prayer's Heart</h2><p>Intention is the heart of any novena, giving it direction, purpose, and power. Without a clear intention, a novena becomes just a series of prayers without focus or meaning. When we pray with intention, we align our hearts with God's will and open ourselves to His grace in a more profound way.</p><p>This intention is not just about what we want, but about what God wants for us and for those we are praying for. It helps us focus our prayers and align our desires with God's perfect plan for our lives and the lives of others.</p><h2>What Makes a Good Intention</h2><p>A good intention for a novena has several characteristics. First, it should be specific enough to give direction to our prayers, but not so rigid that it prevents God from working in unexpected ways. Second, it should be aligned with God's will and the teachings of the Church.</p><p>Third, it should be motivated by love for God and others, not by selfish desires. Fourth, it should be something that we are willing to surrender to God's will, trusting that He knows what is best for us and for those we are praying for.</p><h2>How to Form Your Intention</h2><p>Forming a good intention for a novena requires prayerful reflection and discernment. First, we should ask ourselves what we truly need and what would be best for us and others. Second, we should examine our motives, ensuring that our intention is pure and loving.</p><p>Third, we should pray for guidance, asking the Holy Spirit to help us form an intention that is aligned with God's will. Fourth, we should be willing to modify our intention as we pray, allowing God to refine our desires and show us what He truly wants for us.</p><h2>Conclusion: The Power of Focused Prayer</h2><p>Having a clear intention in a novena transforms it from a series of prayers into a focused spiritual journey. This intention gives our prayers direction and power, helping us align our hearts with God's will.</p><p>When we pray with intention, we become more open to God's grace and more likely to see His work in our lives. We develop a deeper relationship with God and a clearer understanding of His will for us.</p><h2>Prayer for Pure Intention</h2><blockquote><p>'Lord Jesus, help us to form pure and focused intentions for our novenas. Give us the wisdom to know what to pray for, the love to pray for others, and the trust to surrender our intentions to Your perfect will. In Your name, Amen.'</p></blockquote></article>
