    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Marriage as Light</h2>
<p>Marriage as a light in the darkness in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Matthew 5:14-16: "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." This passage shows that marriage as a light in the darkness is not just a nice concept but is a divine calling where married couples are called to be the light of the world. When couples understand marriage as a light in the darkness, they are not just being good but are actively being a light to the world and shining God's love in the darkness.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that marriage as a light in the darkness is not just about being good but is about actively being a light to the world and shining God's love in the darkness. When couples understand this light, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to be a light.</p>

<h2>Light as Divine Calling</h2>
<p>Marriage as a light in the darkness recognizes that being a light is not just a nice quality but is a divine calling to shine God's love in the world. Just as we are called to be the light of the world and to let our light shine before others, so too are married couples called to be a light in the darkness and to shine God's love. This light is not about being hidden but is about being visible and shining.</p>

<p>When couples understand marriage as a light in the darkness, they are not just being good but are actively being a light to the world. They are able to be a light in the darkness and shine God's love, to let their light shine before others, to be examples of God's love and goodness, to inspire others toward God's light, and to give glory to God through their marriage. This light becomes a powerful witness to God's love.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Being a Light</h2>
<p>Understanding marriage as a light in the darkness is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes being a light in the darkness and shining God's love, letting one's light shine before others, being examples of God's love and goodness, inspiring others toward God's light, and giving glory to God through marriage. These daily practices of being a light build a strong foundation for the relationship.</p>

<p>This daily practice includes being willing to be a light in the darkness and to shine God's love in the world through one's marriage, being willing to let one's light shine before others and to be visible examples of God's love, being willing to be examples of God's love and goodness and to inspire others toward God, being willing to inspire others toward God's light and to encourage them toward holiness, and being willing to give glory to God through one's marriage and to point others toward Him. When couples practice being a light in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and shining.</p>

<h2>Being a Light and Communication</h2>
<p>Understanding marriage as a light in the darkness is closely connected to communication. When couples are able to communicate about their calling to be a light and their desire to shine God's love, they are better able to be a light effectively. Good communication helps couples to discuss their witness, to plan ways to shine their light, and to work together in being a light.</p>

When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are building a relationship based on light and witness.</p>

<h2>Being a Light and Growth</h2>

When couples are a light in the darkness, they are growing in virtues like witness, goodness, and glory. These virtues help them to become better people and better spouses. They also help them to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>
