    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of the Call to Holiness</h2>
<p>Marriage and the call to holiness in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in 1 Peter 1:15-16: "But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" This passage shows that marriage and the call to holiness is not just a nice concept but is a divine calling where married couples are called to be holy in all their conduct. When couples understand marriage and the call to holiness, they are not just being religious but are actively responding to God's call to be holy and growing together in sanctification.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that marriage and the call to holiness is not just about individual holiness but is about growing together in holiness as a couple and supporting each other in the journey toward sanctification. When couples understand this call, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to grow in holiness together.</p>

<h2>Holiness as a Shared Journey</h2>
<p>Marriage and the call to holiness recognizes that holiness is not just an individual pursuit but is a shared journey that couples undertake together. Just as God calls each individual to be holy, so too does He call married couples to be holy together and to support each other in their journey toward sanctification. This holiness is not about being perfect but is about being willing to grow in holiness together.</p>

<p>When couples understand marriage and the call to holiness, they are not just being religious but are actively responding to God's call to be holy together. They are able to support each other in their spiritual growth and development, to pray together for holiness and sanctification, to encourage each other in virtuous living, to help each other overcome sin and temptation, and to grow together in holiness and sanctification. This holiness becomes a powerful shared journey toward sanctification.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Growing in Holiness</h2>
<p>Understanding marriage and the call to holiness is practiced in the small, everyday moments of married life. This includes supporting each other in spiritual growth and development, praying together for holiness and sanctification, encouraging each other in virtuous living, helping each other overcome sin and temptation, and growing together in holiness and sanctification. These daily practices of growing in holiness build a strong foundation for the relationship.</p>

<p>This daily practice includes being willing to support one's spouse in their spiritual growth and development and to encourage their journey toward holiness, being willing to pray together for holiness and sanctification and to seek God's help in growing in holiness, being willing to encourage one's spouse in virtuous living and to be an example of virtue, being willing to help one's spouse overcome sin and temptation and to be a source of strength and support, and being willing to grow together in holiness and sanctification and to work toward sanctification as a couple. When couples practice growing in holiness in these small ways, they are building a marriage that is strong and holy.</p>

<h2>Growing in Holiness and Communication</h2>
<p>Understanding marriage and the call to holiness is closely connected to communication. When couples are able to communicate about their call to holiness and their spiritual growth, they are better able to grow in holiness together effectively. Good communication helps couples to discuss their spiritual journey, to share their struggles and victories, and to support each other in holiness.</p>

<p>This communication for growing in holiness includes being willing to discuss one's spiritual growth and journey toward holiness with one's spouse, being willing to share one's struggles and victories in the spiritual life, being willing to pray together for holiness and sanctification, being willing to encourage each other in virtuous living, and being willing to support each other in overcoming sin and temptation. When couples communicate in these ways, they are not just sharing information but are building a relationship based on shared holiness.</p>

<h2>Growing in Holiness and Growth</h2>
<p>Understanding marriage and the call to holiness is essential for personal and spiritual growth. When couples grow in holiness together, they are growing in virtues like holiness, virtue, and sanctification. These virtues help them to become better people and better spouses. They also help them to become better witnesses to God's love in the world.</p>

<p>This growth through growing in holiness includes growing in holiness as they learn to be holy together, growing in virtue as they learn to live virtuous lives together, growing in sanctification as they learn to grow in sanctification together, growing in prayer as they learn to pray together for holiness, and growing in witness as they learn to be witnesses to God's holiness. When couples grow in these virtues, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Holy Love</h2>
<p>Marriage and the call to holiness in Catholic marriage is a holy love that helps couples to grow in holiness and to build a strong and lasting relationship. When couples understand marriage and the call to holiness, they are not just being religious but are actively responding to God's call to be holy and growing together in sanctification.</p>

<p>As we reflect on marriage and the call to holiness, let us remember that this holiness is not just a human achievement but is a divine calling that requires God's grace. When we grow in holiness together, we are building a marriage that is based on holiness, sanctification, and the grace of God.</p></article>
