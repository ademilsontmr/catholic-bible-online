    <article><h2>Saint Joseph in Scripture</h2><p>Saint Joseph appears in the Gospels as the husband of Mary and the foster father of Jesus. Though he speaks no words in Scripture, his actions speak volumes about his character. He was a just man who, when he learned of Mary's pregnancy, planned to divorce her quietly rather than expose her to shame. When an angel appeared to him in a dream, he immediately took Mary as his wife and accepted his role as Jesus' father.</p><h2>Patron of the Universal Church</h2><p>Pope Pius IX declared Saint Joseph the patron of the Universal Church in 1870. This honor recognizes Joseph's role in protecting and providing for the Holy Family, which is a model for the Church. Just as Joseph protected Jesus and Mary, he continues to protect the Church and all its members through his intercession.</p><h2>Model of Fatherhood</h2><p>Saint Joseph is the perfect model of fatherhood. He was a loving, protective, and hardworking father who put his family's needs before his own. He taught Jesus the trade of carpentry and provided for his family through honest labor. His quiet strength and devotion to his family make him an inspiration for all fathers.</p><h2>Patron of Workers</h2><p>As a carpenter, Saint Joseph is the patron saint of workers. He reminds us that all honest work is valuable and can be offered to God. His example teaches us to work with integrity, to provide for our families, and to see our work as a way to serve God and others. On May 1st, the Church celebrates the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker.</p><h2>Devotion to Saint Joseph</h2><p>Devotion to Saint Joseph has grown throughout Church history. Many saints, including Saint Teresa of Avila, had great devotion to him and recommended praying to him for various needs. The Church celebrates his feast day on March 19th, and the month of March is traditionally dedicated to him.</p><h2>Prayers to Saint Joseph</h2><p>There are many beautiful prayers to Saint Joseph. The 'Prayer to Saint Joseph' asks for his intercession: 'O Saint Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires. O Saint Joseph, do assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your divine Son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, our Lord.'</p><h2>Feast Days and Celebrations</h2><p>Saint Joseph is honored with several feast days throughout the year. March 19th is his principal feast day, celebrating his role as husband of Mary. May 1st is the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker. The Wednesday of each week is traditionally dedicated to Saint Joseph, and many people pray to him on Wednesdays for special intentions.</p></article>
