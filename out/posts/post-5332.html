    <article><h2>The Biblical Foundation of Guarding the Marriage Bed</h2>
<p>Guarding the marriage bed in purity in Catholic marriage is deeply rooted in Scripture, particularly in Hebrews 13:4: "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous." This passage shows that guarding the marriage bed in purity is not just a nice concept but is a divine command that honors the sanctity of marriage. When couples understand guarding the marriage bed in purity, they are not just being moral but are actively honoring the sanctity of their marriage and protecting the sacred bond that God has created.</p>

<p>This biblical foundation shows that guarding the marriage bed in purity is not just about avoiding sin but is about actively honoring the sanctity of marriage and protecting the sacred bond that God has created. When couples understand this guarding, they are not just improving their relationship but are growing in holiness and becoming more faithful to their vocation. This understanding is not about being perfect but is about being willing to guard the sanctity of marriage.</p>

<h2>Purity as a Sacred Protection</h2>
<p>Guarding the marriage bed in purity recognizes that purity is not just a moral requirement but is a sacred protection that honors the sanctity of marriage. Just as God commands us to hold marriage in honor and to keep the marriage bed undefiled, so too are married couples called to guard the purity of their marriage bed. This guarding is not about being restrictive but is about being protective and honoring.</p>

<p>When couples understand guarding the marriage bed in purity, they are not just being moral but are actively honoring the sanctity of their marriage. They are able to protect the sacred bond of their marriage, to honor the gift of sexuality within marriage, to avoid anything that could defile their marriage bed, to grow in purity and holiness together, and to be examples of marital purity to others. This guarding becomes a powerful protection of the sacred bond.</p>

<h2>The Daily Practice of Guarding Purity</h2>
