                Born c. 931 in Burgundy, St. Adelaide married, at 15 or 16, Lothair of Italy to whom her father had engaged her when she was two. When Lothair died three years later, his successor and usurper Berengar of Ivrea imprisoned Adelaide and attempted to force her to marry his son.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Legends tell of Adelaide's escape to Canossa, where she appealed to Otto of Germany for help. He conquered Italy and married her in 951. John XII crowned the pair rulers of the Holy Roman Empire the following year. After Otto's death in 973, Adelaide quarrelled with Otto II, possibly at the instigation of her daughter-in-law, Theophano, and lived with her brother in Burgundy.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                She established many monasteries and churches; she also became interested in evangelism. She and her son reconciled before his death in 983, and she became regent for her grandson, Otto III. Adelaide died in 999 at the convent at Seltz, which she had founded. Cluny became the center of her cult. She was canonized in 1097.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Adelaide's legacy demonstrates that holiness can be achieved even in the highest positions of worldly power. As Holy Roman Empress, she used her influence and wealth not for personal gain, but for the service of God and the Church. Her example shows that those in positions of authority have a special responsibility to use their power for the good of others.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Adelaide's experience of being imprisoned and forced into marriage makes her a powerful patroness for victims of abuse and forced marriages. Her escape and subsequent rise to power shows that God can bring good out of even the most difficult circumstances. She serves as an inspiration for those who have suffered at the hands of others.

                St. Adelaide's establishment of many monasteries and churches, along with her interest in evangelism, shows her commitment to spreading the Gospel and strengthening the Church. Her patronage of religious institutions helped to preserve and spread the faith throughout Europe during a crucial period in Church history.

              <p>
                St. Adelaide's reconciliation with her son Otto II before his death demonstrates the importance of family unity and forgiveness. Despite their quarrels, she was able to overcome differences and provide stability as regent for her grandson. Her example teaches us the value of reconciliation and the importance of maintaining family bonds.
