                St. Anthony of Padua was born Fernando Martins de Bulh√µes in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1195. 
                He came from a wealthy family and received an excellent education, joining the Augustinian 
                Canons at the age of 15. His life took a dramatic turn when he encountered the Franciscan 
                friars who were martyred in Morocco.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Inspired by their courage and faith, Fernando joined the Franciscan order and took the name 
                Anthony. He hoped to preach to the Muslims in Morocco, but illness forced him to return to 
                Europe. On his journey back, his ship was blown off course and landed in Sicily.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Anthony's true calling was revealed at an ordination ceremony in Forl√¨, Italy. When no one 
                was prepared to give the sermon, Anthony was asked to speak. His eloquence and knowledge of 
                Scripture amazed everyone present. From that moment, he became known as a powerful preacher 
                and teacher.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Anthony traveled throughout Italy and France, preaching to large crowds and performing many 
                miracles. He was known for his ability to explain complex theological concepts in simple terms 
                that ordinary people could understand. His sermons were so powerful that even fish were said 
                to gather to listen when he preached by the sea.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Anthony died in Padua, Italy, on June 13, 1231, at the age of 36. He was canonized less 
                than a year after his death by Pope Gregory IX, who called him the "Ark of the Testament" 
                and the "Repository of Holy Scripture." In 1946, Pope Pius XII declared him a Doctor of the Church.

                St. Anthony's legacy as a Doctor of the Church is marked by his profound knowledge of Scripture 
                and his ability to communicate God's truth with clarity and power. His writings and sermons 
                continue to inspire theologians and preachers today, showing how to make complex spiritual 
                truths accessible to all people.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Throughout his life, St. Anthony performed numerous miracles, earning him the title "Wonder Worker." 
                These miracles included healing the sick, raising the dead, and even making a mule kneel before 
                the Blessed Sacrament. His miraculous intercession continues to be sought by millions of people 
                around the world.

              <p className="mb-6">
                As a Franciscan friar, St. Anthony embodied the ideals of poverty, humility, and service to others. 
                He showed how to combine deep learning with simple living, and how to use one's gifts and talents 
                for the glory of God and the service of others.

              <p>
                St. Anthony's most popular legacy is his role as the patron saint of lost items. This devotion 
                began when a novice stole his psalter, and Anthony prayed for its return. The thief was so 
                frightened by a vision that he returned the book. Today, people around the world pray "Tony, 
                Tony, look around, something's lost and must be found" when they lose something.

                processions with his statue, and people often give bread to the poor in his honor, as he was
