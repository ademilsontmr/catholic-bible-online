                St. Andrew, the first-called apostle, was a Galilean fisherman and 
                the brother of St. Peter. Before becoming a disciple of Jesus, he 
                was a follower of John the Baptist, demonstrating his spiritual 
                seeking and preparation for the coming of the Messiah. When John 
                the Baptist pointed to Jesus and said, "Behold the Lamb of God," 
                Andrew immediately followed Jesus and became one of His first disciples.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After spending time with Jesus, Andrew's first act as an apostle 
                was to bring his brother Simon (Peter) to Christ, saying, "We have 
                found the Messiah." This act of evangelization, bringing his own 
                brother to Jesus, demonstrates Andrew's missionary zeal and his 
                understanding of the importance of sharing the Good News with those 
                closest to him.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Andrew is often referred to as the "first-called" because he 
                was among the first disciples to be called by Jesus. His immediate 
                response to Jesus' call and his eagerness to bring others to Christ 
                set the pattern for all future apostles and evangelizers.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, St. Andrew preached 
                the Gospel in Asia Minor and then in Greece. His missionary work 
                took him to various regions, where he tirelessly proclaimed the 
                message of Christ and established Christian communities.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Andrew's missionary journey ended in Greece, where he was crucified 
                on a transverse cross (X-shaped), which has become his distinctive 
                symbol. According to tradition, he was crucified in Patras, Greece, 
                and his martyrdom was marked by his continued preaching from the cross, 
                encouraging the people to remain faithful to Christ even as he faced 
                his own death.

                St. Andrew's legacy begins with his unique title as the "first-called" 
                apostle. His immediate response to Jesus' call and his eagerness to 
                follow Christ set the standard for all future disciples. His example 
                teaches us the importance of being ready to respond to God's call 
                and the willingness to leave everything behind to follow Jesus.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Andrew's first act after meeting Jesus was to bring his brother 
                Peter to Christ. This simple but profound act of evangelization 
                demonstrates that sharing the Good News often begins with those closest 
                to us. His example shows that evangelization doesn't require complex 
                arguments or extensive training, but simply the desire to share the 
                joy of encountering Christ with others.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Andrew's missionary work in Asia Minor and Greece demonstrates 
                his commitment to spreading the Gospel to distant lands. His willingness 
                to travel far from home and face the challenges of preaching in foreign 
                cultures shows his dedication to the Great Commission and his love 
                for souls.

              <p>
                St. Andrew's martyrdom on the transverse cross in Greece represents 
                the ultimate witness to Christ. His willingness to die for his faith 
                and his continued preaching even from the cross demonstrate the depth 
                of his commitment to Christ and his desire to bring others to salvation. 
                His martyrdom has inspired countless Christians throughout history 
                to remain faithful even in the face of persecution and death.
