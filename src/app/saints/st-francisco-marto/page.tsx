          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francisco Marto was born on June 11, 1908, in the small village of Aljustrel near Fátima, 
                Portugal. He was the youngest son of Manuel and Olimpia Marto, and together with his sister 
                Jacinta and their cousin Lúcia dos Santos, he would become one of the most famous children 
                in Catholic history. Francisco was typical of Portuguese village children of that time - 
                illiterate but with a rich oral tradition, and he worked with his family taking care of 
                their sheep in the fields around Fátima.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                According to Lúcia's memoirs, Francisco had a placid disposition and was somewhat musically 
                inclined. He liked to be by himself to think, often preferring solitude to the company of 
                others. This introspective nature would later serve him well in his spiritual life, as he 
                developed a deep love for prayer and contemplation. Francisco was known for his gentle, 
                peaceful character and his ability to find joy in simple things.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1916, when Francisco was just eight years old, he and his companions experienced three 
                apparitions of an angel who identified himself as the Angel of Portugal. The angel taught 
                them prayers and prepared them for the extraordinary events that would follow. These 
                angelic visits were the beginning of a spiritual journey that would transform their lives 
                and the lives of millions of people around the world.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The most significant events in Francisco's life began on May 13, 1917, when he was nine 
                years old. On that day, while tending sheep with his sister Jacinta and cousin Lúcia, 
                they witnessed the first apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Our Lady appeared to them 
                as a beautiful lady dressed in white, more brilliant than the sun, holding a rosary in her 
                hands. She asked them to return to the same place on the 13th of each month for the next 
                six months.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During the apparitions, Francisco could see Our Lady but could not hear her speak. He 
                would ask Lúcia what the Lady was saying, and she would relay the messages to him. This 
                unique experience of being able to see but not hear the Virgin Mary would become a source 
                of both joy and suffering for Francisco. He would often say that he wanted to "console 
                Jesus for the sins of the world" and would spend long hours in prayer, especially after 
                the apparitions began.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Following their experiences with the angel and Our Lady, all three children gave up music 
                and dancing, believing that these and other recreational activities led to occasions of 
                sin. Francisco, in particular, became deeply committed to prayer and penance. He would 
                often be found praying alone, sometimes for hours at a time, and he developed a special 
                devotion to the Eucharist and to making reparation for the sins of the world.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During the third apparition on July 13, 1917, the children were shown a terrifying vision 
                of Hell, which deeply affected all three of them. Francisco, though he could not hear the 
                words, was profoundly moved by what he saw. This vision, combined with Our Lady's request 
                for prayer and penance for the conversion of sinners, led Francisco to practice stringent 
                self-mortifications. He would often skip meals, go without water on hot days, and wear 
                a rope around his waist as a form of penance.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francisco's health began to decline in 1918 when he contracted the Spanish flu, which was 
                ravaging Europe at the time. Despite his illness, he continued to pray and offer his 
                sufferings for the conversion of sinners. He would often say, "I want to console Our Lord 
                and Our Lady very much." His illness progressed, and he became bedridden, but he never 
                complained and continued to offer his sufferings as a sacrifice.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Francisco Marto died on April 4, 1919, at the age of ten, just a few weeks before his 
                eleventh birthday. His last words were, "Look, mother, at that beautiful light by the 
                door!" He died peacefully, with a smile on his face, having lived a life of extraordinary 
                holiness for one so young. His sister Jacinta would follow him to heaven less than a year 
                later, and both would be beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 13, 2000. Francisco was 
                canonized by Pope Francis on May 13, 2017, on the 100th anniversary of the first Fátima 
                apparition.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Witness of Divine Apparitions</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francisco Marto's greatest legacy is his role as one of the three children who witnessed 
                the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima. His testimony, along with that of his sister Jacinta 
                and cousin Lúcia, has given rise to one of the most important centers of Christian pilgrimage 
                in the world. The Fátima apparitions have had a profound impact on the Catholic Church and 
                have inspired millions of people to greater devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to prayer 
                and penance.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Childlike Holiness</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francisco's life demonstrates that holiness is not limited by age. At just ten years old, 
                he achieved a level of spiritual maturity and devotion that many adults never reach. His 
                simple, childlike faith, his love for prayer, and his willingness to make sacrifices for 
                the conversion of sinners make him a powerful example for children and adults alike. His 
                canonization as a child saint emphasizes the Church's recognition that even the youngest 
                among us can achieve great holiness.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Devotion to Prayer and Contemplation</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francisco's love for prayer and his preference for solitude demonstrate the importance of 
                contemplative prayer in the spiritual life. His desire to "console Jesus for the sins of 
                the world" shows a deep understanding of the power of prayer and the call to intercede 
                for others. His example teaches us that prayer is not just asking for things, but also 
                offering ourselves in love and reparation for the sins of others.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Acceptance of Suffering</h3>
              <p>
                Francisco's acceptance of his illness and his offering of his sufferings for the conversion 
                of sinners demonstrate a profound understanding of the redemptive value of suffering. He 
                never complained about his illness but instead saw it as an opportunity to help save souls. 
                His peaceful death, with a smile on his face, shows the joy that comes from living a life 
                of love and sacrifice. His example continues to inspire those who are suffering to offer 
                their pain for the good of others.

                The feast of St. Francisco Marto is celebrated on April 4th, commemorating the day of his 
                death in 1919. This feast honors his life as one of the three children of Fátima, his 
                witness to the apparitions of Our Lady, and his extraordinary holiness at such a young age. 
                It is a day to remember his example of prayer, penance, and love for Jesus and Mary.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Historical Context</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francisco lived during a tumultuous period in world history, including World War I 
                and the Spanish flu pandemic. His apparitions took place during a time when the world 
                was in great need of hope and peace. The messages of Fátima, which Francisco helped to 
                transmit, called for prayer, penance, and conversion, offering a spiritual solution to 
                the problems facing the world. His canonization in 2017, on the 100th anniversary of 
                the first apparition, emphasized the continued relevance of the Fátima message.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Devotional Practices</h3>
              <p>
                On his feast day, Catholics pray for his intercession, especially for children, for those 
                seeking to grow in prayer and contemplation, for those who are suffering, and for the 
                conversion of sinners. His example inspires us to develop a deeper prayer life, to offer 
                our sufferings for others, and to have childlike trust in God and Our Lady. Many also 
                pray the Rosary, which was so important to the Fátima message.
