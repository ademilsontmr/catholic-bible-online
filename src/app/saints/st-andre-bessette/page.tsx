              <p className="mb-6">
                When Alfred Bessette came to the Holy Cross Brothers in 1870, he carried with him a note 
                from his pastor saying, "I am sending you a saint." The Brothers found that difficult to 
                believe. Chronic stomach pains had made it impossible for Alfred to hold a job very long, 
                and since he was a boy he had wandered from shop to shop, farm to farm, in his native 
                Canada and in the United States, staying only until his employers found out how little 
                work he could do.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The Holy Cross Brothers were teachers, and at 25, Alfred still did not know how to read 
                and write. It seemed as if Alfred approached the religious order out of desperation, not 
                vocation. Alfred was desperate, but he was also prayerful and deeply devoted to God and 
                Saint Joseph. He may have had no place left to go, but he believed that was because this 
                was the place he felt he should have been all along.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The Holy Cross Brothers took him into the novitiate but soon found out what others had 
                learned ‚Äî as hard as Alfred, now Brother Andre, wanted to work, he simply wasn't strong 
                enough. They asked him to leave the order, but Andre, out of desperation again, appealed 
                to a visiting bishop who promised him that Andre would stay and take his vows.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After his vows, Brother Andre was sent to Notre Dame College in Montreal (a school for 
                boys age seven to twelve) as a porter. There his responsibilities were to answer the door, 
                to welcome guests, find the people they were visiting, wake up those in the school, and 
                deliver mail. Brother Andre joked later, "At the end of my novitiate, my superiors showed 
                me the door, and I stayed there for forty years."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1904, he surprised the Archbishop of Montreal by requesting permission to build a 
                chapel to Saint Joseph on the mountain near the college. The Archbishop refused to go into 
                debt and would only give permission for Brother Andre to build what he had money for. 
                What money did Brother Andre have? Nickels he had collected as donations for Saint Joseph 
                from haircuts he gave the boys, and nickels and dimes from a small dish he had kept in a 
                picnic shelter on top of the mountain near a statue of St. Joseph with a sign "Donations 
                for St. Joseph."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                He had collected this change for years but he still had only a few hundred dollars. Who 
                would start a chapel now with so little funding? Andre took his few hundred dollars and 
                built what he could ‚Äî a small wood shelter only fifteen feet by eighteen feet. He kept 
                collecting money and went back three years later to request more building. The wary 
                Archbishop asked him, "Are you having visions of Saint Joseph telling you to build a 
                church for him?" Brother Andre reassured him, "I have only my great devotion to St. Joseph 
                to guide me."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The Archbishop granted him permission to keep building as long as he didn't go into debt. 
                He started by adding a roof so that all the people who were coming to hear Mass at the 
                shrine wouldn't have to stand out in the rain and the wind. Then came walls, heating, a 
                paved road up the mountain, a shelter for pilgrims, and finally a place where Brother 
                Andre and others could live and take care of the shrine ‚Äî and the pilgrims who came ‚Äî 
                full-time.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Through kindness, caring, and devotion, Brother Andre helped many souls experience healing 
                and renewal on the mountaintop. There were even cases of physical healing. But for 
                everything, Brother Andre thanked St. Joseph. Despite financial troubles, Brother Andre 
                never lost faith or devotion. He had started to build a basilica on the mountain but the 
                Depression had interfered.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                At ninety-years old he told his co-workers to place a statue of St. Joseph in the 
                unfinished, unroofed basilica. He was so ill he had to be carried up the mountain to see 
                the statue in its new home. Brother Andre died soon after on January 6, and didn't live 
                to see the work on the basilica completed. But in Brother Andre's mind it never would be 
                completed because he always saw more ways to express his devotion and to heal others. 
                As long as he lived, the man who had trouble keeping work for himself, would never have 
                stopped working for God.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Andre Bessette's legacy is marked by his extraordinary example of how God can use the 
                most unlikely people to accomplish great things. Despite his physical limitations, lack of 
                education, and humble background, Brother Andre became one of the most beloved and 
                effective servants of God in Canadian history. His life shows that true greatness comes 
                not from human ability but from complete trust in God and devotion to His will.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Builder of St. Joseph's Oratory</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Brother Andre's crowning achievement was the construction of St. Joseph's Oratory on Mount 
                Royal in Montreal, which has become one of the world's most visited pilgrimage sites. 
                Starting with just a few hundred dollars in nickels and dimes, he built what began as a 
                small wooden shelter and grew into a magnificent basilica. His method of building "what 
                he could afford" and trusting in God's providence has inspired countless others to start 
                small and let God multiply their efforts.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Miracle Worker and Healer</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Through his deep devotion to St. Joseph and his simple faith, Brother Andre became 
                instrumental in many physical and spiritual healings. His reputation as a miracle worker 
                spread far and wide, drawing thousands of pilgrims to the Oratory. Yet he always 
                attributed any healing or blessing to St. Joseph, never taking credit for himself.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Perseverance and Trust</h3>
              <p>
                Brother Andre's life demonstrates the power of perseverance in the face of seemingly 
                insurmountable obstacles. Rejected by employers, nearly dismissed from his religious 
                order, and facing constant financial challenges, he never gave up on his dream of honoring 
                St. Joseph. His unwavering trust in God's providence and his determination to serve others 
                despite his own limitations make him a powerful example for all who face difficulties in 
                their spiritual journey.
