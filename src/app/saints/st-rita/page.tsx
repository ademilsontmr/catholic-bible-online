              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Rita of Cascia was born Margherita Lotti in 1381 in Roccaporena, a small village near 
                Cascia, Italy. From an early age, she showed a deep desire to become a nun, but her parents 
                arranged for her to marry Paolo Mancini, a man known for his violent temper and involvement 
                in local feuds.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Despite the difficult circumstances of her marriage, Rita remained patient and prayerful. 
                She endured her husband's abuse with great patience and love, eventually converting him 
                through her example of Christian virtue. Together they had two sons, but tragedy struck 
                when Paolo was murdered in a feud, and her sons vowed to avenge their father's death.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Rita prayed fervently that her sons would not commit murder, and her prayers were answered 
                when both sons died of natural causes before they could carry out their revenge. Now a widow 
                and childless, Rita finally pursued her childhood dream of becoming a nun.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Initially, the Augustinian nuns of Cascia refused to accept her because she was a widow, 
                but through her persistence and the intercession of her patron saints, she was finally 
                admitted to the convent. There, she lived a life of prayer, penance, and charity, becoming 
                known for her holiness and miraculous intercession.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1442, Rita received a mystical wound on her forehead, resembling a thorn from Christ's 
                crown. This stigmata caused her great pain and marked her as a special friend of Christ. 
                She died on May 22, 1457, and was canonized in 1900 by Pope Leo XIII. Today, St. Rita is 
                one of the most popular saints for impossible cases and desperate situations.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Rita's most enduring legacy is her role as the patron saint of impossible cases and 
                desperate situations. Her own life was filled with seemingly impossible circumstances - 
                an abusive marriage, the murder of her husband, the threat of her sons becoming murderers, 
                and the rejection by the convent. Yet through prayer and trust in God, she overcame all 
                these challenges.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Patience and Forgiveness</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Rita's extraordinary patience in the face of suffering and her ability to forgive 
                those who wronged her serve as a powerful example for all Christians. She showed that 
                true strength comes not from revenge or violence, but from love, patience, and trust 
                in God's plan.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Advocate for Abused Women</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As a woman who endured domestic abuse and overcame it through faith and prayer, St. Rita 
                has become a powerful advocate for abused women and victims of domestic violence. Her 
                example shows that there is hope and healing even in the most difficult circumstances.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Mystical Union with Christ</h3>
              <p>
                St. Rita's stigmata - the wound on her forehead - marked her as one specially chosen by 
                Christ to share in His sufferings. This mystical union with Christ's passion makes her 
                a powerful intercessor for all who are suffering, especially those who feel abandoned 
                or hopeless.
