          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Barnabas, originally named Joseph, was born in Cyprus to Jewish parents. His life is primarily documented 
                in the New Testament, particularly in the Acts of the Apostles, where he emerges as one of the most important 
                figures in the early Christian Church.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                A man of remarkable generosity and faith, Barnabas sold his property and gave the proceeds to the Apostles 
                to support the fledgling Christian community in Jerusalem. This act of selflessness earned him the name 
                "Barnabas," which means "Son of Encouragement" or "Son of Consolation" - a fitting title for one who would 
                become a great encourager and peacemaker in the early Church.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Barnabas played a crucial role in the acceptance of St. Paul into the Christian community. When Paul, then 
                known as Saul, arrived in Jerusalem after his conversion, the disciples were afraid of him, remembering his 
                previous persecution of Christians. It was Barnabas who took Paul under his wing, vouched for his genuine 
                conversion, and introduced him to the Apostles.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Together with Paul, Barnabas embarked on the first missionary journey, traveling to Cyprus, Perga, Antioch 
                in Pisidia, Iconium, and Lystra. Their partnership was marked by both great success and intense persecution. 
                In Lystra, they were first mistaken for gods by the pagans, then violently opposed by the Jews who stoned 
                Paul and left him for dead.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Barnabas and Paul also played a crucial role in the Council of Jerusalem, where they defended the position 
                that Gentile converts did not need to follow Jewish customs like circumcision. This decision was fundamental 
                to the spread of Christianity beyond the Jewish community.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Despite their close partnership, Barnabas and Paul eventually parted ways over a disagreement regarding John 
                Mark, Barnabas's cousin. Paul objected to taking Mark on another journey because he had deserted them earlier, 
                but Barnabas insisted on giving him a second chance. This disagreement led to their separation, with Barnabas 
                taking Mark to Cyprus while Paul chose Silas as his companion.

                St. Barnabas exemplifies the virtues of encouragement, generosity, and reconciliation. His willingness to 
                give up his wealth for the sake of the Gospel demonstrates the radical commitment required of Christ's followers. 
                His role as a peacemaker and bridge-builder between Jewish and Gentile Christians was crucial for the unity 
                and growth of the early Church.

                Barnabas's very name, meaning "Son of Encouragement," reflects his character and ministry. He consistently 
                supported and encouraged others in their faith journey. His defense of Paul and his willingness to give John 
                Mark a second chance show his commitment to seeing the best in others and helping them grow.

                Barnabas's missionary journeys with Paul established the pattern for Christian evangelization that would 
                spread throughout the Roman Empire. His work in Cyprus and his role in the Council of Jerusalem helped 
                establish Christianity as a universal faith open to all peoples.

                Barnabas's participation in the Council of Jerusalem helped resolve one of the most critical issues facing 
                the early Church. His example continues to inspire Christians to work for unity and reconciliation in the 
                Church and in the world.
