              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francis of Assisi was born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone in 1181 or 1182 in Assisi, 
                Italy. He was the son of a wealthy cloth merchant and lived a life of luxury and pleasure 
                in his youth. However, his life changed dramatically when he experienced a profound 
                conversion after being imprisoned during a war between Assisi and Perugia.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After his release from prison, Francis began to spend time in prayer and solitude. One day, 
                while praying in the ruined church of San Damiano, he heard the voice of Christ saying, 
                "Francis, rebuild my church." Taking this literally, Francis began to repair the church 
                building, but he soon realized that God was calling him to rebuild the Church spiritually.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francis renounced his wealth and inheritance, choosing to live in poverty and simplicity. 
                He began to preach the Gospel and attracted followers who shared his vision of living 
                according to the teachings of Jesus. In 1209, Pope Innocent III approved the Franciscan 
                order, which Francis called the "Order of Friars Minor" (Little Brothers).
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francis had a deep love for all of God's creation, especially animals and nature. He is 
                said to have preached to the birds and tamed a fierce wolf that was terrorizing the town 
                of Gubbio. His love for creation led him to compose the "Canticle of the Sun," a beautiful 
                hymn praising God for all His creatures.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1224, while praying on Mount La Verna, Francis received the stigmata - the wounds of 
                Christ on his hands, feet, and side. He died on October 3, 1226, at the age of 44. He was 
                canonized just two years later by Pope Gregory IX. Today, St. Francis is one of the most 
                beloved saints in the Catholic Church and is the patron saint of ecology and animals.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francis's most enduring legacy is the Franciscan order, which continues to serve the 
                Church and the world today. The Franciscans, with their commitment to poverty, simplicity, 
                and service to the poor, have inspired countless men and women to follow Christ more closely. 
                The order includes the Friars Minor, the Poor Clares, and the Secular Franciscans.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Patron of Ecology</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francis's deep love for creation has made him the patron saint of ecology and the 
                environment. His example teaches us to respect and care for all of God's creatures and 
                to see the beauty and goodness in all of creation. His "Canticle of the Sun" continues 
                to inspire environmental awareness and care for the earth.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Poverty and Simplicity</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francis's radical embrace of poverty and simplicity challenges us to examine our own 
                relationship with material possessions. He showed that true happiness comes not from 
                wealth or possessions, but from a deep relationship with God and service to others. 
                His example continues to inspire people to live more simply and generously.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Peacemaker</h3>
              <p>
                St. Francis was a great peacemaker who worked to reconcile enemies and bring peace to 
                warring factions. His famous prayer, "Lord, make me an instrument of your peace," 
                continues to inspire people around the world to work for peace and reconciliation. 
                He showed that peace begins with inner transformation and love for all people.

              <p className="mb-6">
                The feast of St. Francis is celebrated on October 4th, the day after his death. This date 
                is particularly significant because it marks the end of the "Season of Creation" in many 
                churches, making it a fitting time to honor this great saint who had such a deep love 
                for all of God's creatures.

              <p className="mb-6">
                On St. Francis's feast day, many churches hold the "Blessing of the Animals" ceremony, 
                where people bring their pets to be blessed. This tradition reflects Francis's love for 
                all creatures. Many people also visit Franciscan churches and shrines, and some participate 
                in environmental activities to honor his commitment to caring for creation.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Prayer and Devotion</h3>
              <p>
                The feast day is an excellent time to pray the Prayer of St. Francis, the Novena to St. Francis, 
                or to read his writings. Many people also make a special effort to care for animals and 
                the environment on this day, following his example of love for all creation.
