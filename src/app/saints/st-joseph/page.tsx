              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Joseph was a carpenter from Nazareth, a descendant of King David, and the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
                Though not mentioned extensively in the Gospels, his role in salvation history is profound and essential.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                According to the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph was a righteous man who, when he discovered Mary was pregnant, 
                planned to divorce her quietly to avoid exposing her to shame. However, an angel appeared to him in a dream, 
                revealing that the child was conceived by the Holy Spirit and instructing him to take Mary as his wife.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Joseph obediently accepted his role as the foster father of Jesus, protecting and providing for the Holy Family. 
                He led them to Bethlehem for the census, where Jesus was born, and later fled with them to Egypt to escape 
                Herod's persecution of the infants.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After returning to Nazareth, Joseph worked as a carpenter, teaching Jesus his trade. The last mention of Joseph 
                in the Gospels is when Jesus was twelve years old and was found in the Temple discussing with the teachers. 
                It is believed that Joseph died before Jesus began his public ministry.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Joseph is often called the "Silent Saint" because no words of his are recorded in Scripture, 
                yet his actions speak volumes about his faith, obedience, and love for God and his family.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Joseph's legacy is one of quiet strength, unwavering faith, and selfless service. He exemplifies 
                the virtues of humility, obedience, and trust in God's plan, even when it seems impossible or difficult.

              <p className="mb-6">
                As the foster father of Jesus, St. Joseph provides a perfect model of fatherhood. He shows us that 
                true fatherhood involves protection, provision, guidance, and love. His example teaches fathers to 
                lead their families with gentleness, strength, and faith.

              <p className="mb-6">
                As a carpenter, St. Joseph sanctified ordinary work and showed that all honest labor can be a means 
                of serving God and providing for one's family. He teaches us the dignity of work and the importance 
                of doing our best in whatever we do.

              <p>
                St. Joseph's role as protector of the Holy Family extends to the entire Church. He continues to 
                watch over and protect all who turn to him in prayer, especially families, workers, and those 
                facing difficult decisions.

                The feast of St. Joseph is celebrated on March 19th as a Solemnity, the highest rank of feast days 
                in the Catholic Church. This date was chosen because it falls during Lent, providing a joyful 
                interlude in the penitential season.

                processions, and family gatherings. It's also traditional to wear red clothing and eat special 
                pastries called "zeppole" in some regions.

                The feast day is an excellent time to pray the Litany of St. Joseph, the Prayer to St. Joseph, 
                or to make a novena to St. Joseph. Many people also consecrate themselves to St. Joseph on this day.
