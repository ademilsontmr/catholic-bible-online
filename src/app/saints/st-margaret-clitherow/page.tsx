          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Margaret Clitherow was born in Middleton, England, in 1555, to Protestant parents. 
                Possessed of good looks and full of wit and merriment, she was a charming personality 
                who brought joy to all who knew her. Her natural charisma and warm disposition made 
                her beloved in her community.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1571, she married John Clitherow, a well-to-do grazier and butcher, and together 
                they had two children. Margaret was a devoted wife and mother, managing their household 
                with love and care. A few years after her marriage, she experienced a profound conversion 
                and entered the Catholic Church, embracing the faith with great zeal and devotion.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Her newfound faith led her to harbor fugitive Catholic priests in her home, providing 
                them with safe haven during the dangerous times of the English Reformation. This act 
                of charity and courage put her at great risk, as the authorities were actively 
                persecuting Catholics and those who aided them.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Eventually, Margaret was arrested and imprisoned by hostile authorities. They used 
                every means possible to make her deny her faith, including threats, intimidation, 
                and psychological pressure. However, the holy woman stood firm in her convictions, 
                refusing to renounce her Catholic faith despite the severe consequences.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Finally, she was condemned to be pressed to death on March 25, 1586. This brutal 
                form of execution involved stretching her out on the ground with a sharp rock on 
                her back and crushing her under a door overladen with unbearable weights. Her bones 
                were broken and she died within fifteen minutes, offering her life as a witness to 
                the truth of the Catholic faith.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The humanity and holiness of this servant of God can be readily glimpsed in her 
                words to a friend when she learned of her condemnation: "The sheriffs have said 
                that I am going to die this coming Friday; and I feel the weakness of my flesh 
                which is troubled at this news, but my spirit rejoices greatly. For the love of 
                God, pray for me and ask all good people to do likewise." Her feast day is 
                celebrated on March 26th.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Margaret Clitherow's legacy is one of extraordinary courage and fidelity to 
                the Catholic faith. Her willingness to face the most brutal form of execution 
                rather than deny her beliefs stands as a powerful witness to the strength of 
                religious conviction and the grace of God working in human hearts.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Conversion</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As a convert from Protestantism to Catholicism, Margaret shows us the power of 
                God's grace to transform hearts and lead people to truth. Her story demonstrates 
                that authentic conversion is not merely intellectual but involves a complete 
                transformation of life and priorities.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Charity and Hospitality</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Margaret's willingness to risk her own safety to harbor Catholic priests 
                demonstrates the virtue of charity in its highest form. She put the needs of 
                others before her own security, showing us what it means to love our neighbor 
                as ourselves, even at great personal cost.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Strength in Weakness</h3>
              <p>
                Her honest admission of her flesh's weakness while rejoicing in her spirit 
                shows the human reality of martyrdom. She teaches us that holiness does not 
                mean the absence of fear or human weakness, but rather the grace to overcome 
                these natural reactions through trust in God and love for Him.
