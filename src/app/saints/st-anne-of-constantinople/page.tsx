              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Anne of Constantinople, also known as Susanna, was born in Constantinople in 840 to aristocratic parents. 
                Growing up in the heart of the Byzantine Empire, she was raised in a world of luxury and privilege, 
                with access to the finest education and opportunities that the imperial capital could offer.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Despite her privileged upbringing, Anne felt called to a different kind of life. When Emperor Basil the Macedonian 
                supported a marriage proposal from a man named Agarenus, Anne faced a difficult decision. Rather than submit 
                to an arranged marriage that would have secured her position in Byzantine society, she chose to flee the city 
                to preserve her freedom and her calling to a life of prayer and solitude.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Anne's flight from Constantinople was a dramatic act of courage and faith. She left behind the security of her 
                aristocratic life, her family, and the imperial court to follow her calling. Her journey took her to Leucadia, 
                a region in Epirus, where she arrived around 896.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In Leucadia, Anne embraced the life of a hermitess, dedicating herself to prayer, fasting, and contemplation. 
                She lived in solitude, far from the political intrigues and social expectations of Constantinople, 
                finding peace and fulfillment in her relationship with God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Anne lived as a hermitess in Leucadia until her death, having found the spiritual freedom she had sought. 
                Her life of prayer and solitude in the mountains of Epirus became a testament to the power of following 
                one's spiritual calling, even when it means leaving behind worldly comforts and expectations.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                There is some historical confusion regarding Anne's identity, as she may be the same person as "Maura" 
                who is listed in the Roman Martyrology as having suffered martyrdom in Constantinople. This connection 
                suggests that Anne's story may have involved even greater trials and ultimately martyrdom for her faith.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Anne's legacy is marked by her extraordinary courage in choosing her spiritual calling over worldly 
                expectations. Her decision to flee Constantinople rather than submit to an arranged marriage demonstrates 
                the depth of her commitment to God and her willingness to sacrifice comfort and security for spiritual freedom.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Witness to Solitude and Prayer</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Anne's life as a hermitess in Leucadia serves as a powerful example of the value of solitude and contemplative prayer. 
                Her choice to live in isolation, dedicating herself entirely to God, shows that true fulfillment comes not from 
                worldly success or social position, but from deep communion with the divine.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Byzantine Christian Heritage</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As a Byzantine saint, Anne represents the rich spiritual tradition of the Eastern Christian world. Her story 
                reflects the challenges faced by women in Byzantine society who felt called to religious life, and her example 
                continues to inspire those seeking to live lives of prayer and devotion.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Possible Martyrdom</h3>
              <p>
                The possible connection between Anne and the martyr "Maura" adds another dimension to her legacy. If Anne 
                did indeed suffer martyrdom in Constantinople, her story becomes even more powerful, showing that her 
                commitment to God was so strong that she was willing to give her life for her faith.
