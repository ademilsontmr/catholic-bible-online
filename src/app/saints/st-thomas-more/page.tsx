          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Thomas More was born in London on February 7, 1478, to Sir John More, a lawyer and judge who rose 
                to prominence during the reign of Edward IV. His father's connections and wealth would help Thomas rise 
                in station as a young man. Thomas' mother was Agnes Graunger, the first wife of John More.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Thomas attended St. Anthony's School, one of the best schools in London at that time. In 1490, he became 
                a household page to John Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England. Archbishop 
                Morton was a Renaissance man and inspired Thomas to pursue his own education.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Thomas More entered Oxford in 1492, where he learned Latin, Greek and prepared for his future studies. 
                In 1494, he left Oxford to become a lawyer and trained in London until 1502 when he was finally approved 
                to begin practice.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Almost as soon as More became a lawyer, he found himself contemplating another path in life. For two years, 
                between 1503 and 1504, More lived next to a Carthusian monastery and found himself called to follow their 
                lifestyle of simple piety. He often joined their spiritual exercises, but by 1504, he had decided to remain 
                in the secular world and stood for election to Parliament.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Thomas More married his first wife, Jane Colt, in 1505. They had four children together before her death 
                in 1511. After Jane's death, Thomas quickly remarried to Alice Harpur Middleton, a wealthy widow. Thomas 
                was considered a doting father and insisted that his daughters receive the same education as his son.

              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1504, More was elected to Parliament to represent the region of Great Yarmouth, and in 1510 rose to 
                represent London. During his service to the people of London, he earned a reputation as being honest and 
                effective. He became a Privy Counselor in 1514 and was knighted in 1521, becoming Under-Treasurer of the Exchequer.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Lord Chancellor</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                More became Lord Chancellor in 1529 and was immediately effective, working with speed and precision that 
                is admired today. He was likely one of Henry VIII's most effective servants and was fiercely loyal to the king. 
                During his tenure, More prosecuted those accused of heresy and worked tirelessly to defend the Catholic faith in England.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">The Crisis of Conscience</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1530, as Henry worked to obtain an annulment from his wife, Catherine, More refused to sign a letter to 
                the Pope requesting an annulment. This was More's first time crossing Henry. The relationship became strained 
                when Henry purged many of the clergy who supported the Pope, making it clear that Henry was prepared to break 
                away from the Church in Rome.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Martyrdom</h3>
              <p>
                In 1532, More found himself unable to work for Henry VIII and offered his resignation, citing failing health. 
                In 1534, More was ordered to take an oath acknowledging Henry as head of the church, which he refused. He was 
                arrested, imprisoned in the Tower of London, and eventually convicted of treason. On July 6, 1535, he ascended 
                the scaffold, proclaiming that he was "the king's good servant, but God's first."

              <p className="mb-6">
                The feast of St. Thomas More is celebrated on June 22nd, commemorating his martyrdom for the faith. 
                This date falls during the summer months, providing an opportunity to reflect on the courage and integrity 
                required to stand up for one's beliefs, even in the face of persecution.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Pope Leo XIII beatified Thomas More in 1886, and he was canonized by Pope Pius XI on May 19, 1935. 
                His canonization recognized not only his martyrdom but also his exemplary life as a lay person who 
                lived his faith in the secular world while maintaining the highest standards of integrity and morality.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Traditions and Devotions</h3>
              <p>
                On his feast day, many people pray for the intercession of St. Thomas More, especially for lawyers, 
                civil servants, and politicians. It's also a time to reflect on the importance of conscience and the 
                courage to stand up for what is right, even when it means personal sacrifice.
