              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Philip was a Galilean who became one of the twelve apostles chosen 
                by Jesus Christ. He is remembered for his important role in bringing 
                Nathanael (also known as Bartholomew) to Christ, demonstrating his 
                missionary zeal and his desire to share the Good News with others.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                According to the Gospel of John, Philip was from Bethsaida, the same 
                town as Andrew and Peter. When Jesus found Philip, He said to him, 
                "Follow me." Philip immediately responded to this call and became 
                a disciple of Christ. His immediate response to Jesus' invitation 
                shows his openness to God's call and his willingness to leave everything 
                behind to follow the Lord.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                One of the most significant moments in St. Philip's life occurred 
                when he found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one about 
                whom Moses wrote in the law, and also the prophets, Jesus son of 
                Joseph, from Nazareth." When Nathanael expressed doubt, saying, "Can 
                anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip simply replied, "Come and 
                see." This simple invitation led Nathanael to encounter Christ and 
                become one of the apostles.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Philip appears in several important moments in the Gospels. During 
                the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, Jesus 
                tested Philip by asking him where they could buy bread to feed the 
                crowd. Philip responded with practical concern about the cost, showing 
                his human nature and the challenges of faith.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                At the Last Supper, Philip asked Jesus to show the Father to the 
                disciples, saying, "Master, show us the Father, and that will be 
                enough for us." Jesus responded with the profound teaching, "Whoever 
                has seen me has seen the Father." This exchange reveals Philip's 
                desire for deeper understanding and Jesus' revelation of His divine 
                nature.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, St. Philip preached 
                the Gospel in Phrygia, a region in Asia Minor. According to tradition, 
                he suffered martyrdom there, giving his life for the faith. His preaching 
                focused on the cross of Christ, which became the central theme of 
                his missionary work and the symbol associated with him.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Philip's most enduring legacy is his role as a model of evangelization. 
                His simple invitation to Nathanael, "Come and see," demonstrates the 
                most effective approach to sharing the faith. Rather than engaging 
                in complex arguments or trying to convince Nathanael with words, 
                Philip invited him to a personal encounter with Christ. This approach 
                teaches us that evangelization is not about winning arguments but 
                about introducing others to Jesus.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Immediate Response to God's Call</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Philip's immediate response to Jesus' invitation, "Follow me," 
                shows his openness to God's call and his willingness to leave everything 
                behind. His example teaches us the importance of being ready to respond 
                to God's call and the willingness to make the necessary sacrifices 
                to follow Christ. Philip's response reminds us that discipleship 
                requires both hearing and acting on God's word.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Seeker of Understanding</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Philip's question at the Last Supper, "Show us the Father," reveals 
                his desire for deeper understanding and his honest seeking of truth. 
                His willingness to ask questions and his desire for clarity demonstrate 
                that faith and reason are not opposed but complementary. Philip's 
                example encourages us to ask questions about our faith and to seek 
                deeper understanding of God's mysteries.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Preacher of the Cross</h3>
              <p>
                St. Philip's missionary work in Phrygia focused on the cross of Christ, 
                which became the central theme of his preaching. His emphasis on 
                the cross demonstrates his understanding that the crucifixion is 
                the central mystery of our faith and the source of our salvation. 
                Philip's legacy teaches us that all Christian preaching must be centered 
                on Christ crucified and that the cross is the ultimate sign of God's 
                love for humanity.
