                Unreliable legend has Vitus, the only son of a senator in Sicily, become a Christian when he was twelve. 
                When his conversions and miracles became widely known to the administrator of Sicily, Valerian, 
                he had Vitus brought before him, to shake his faith.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                He was unsuccessful, but Vitus with his tutor, Modestus, and servant, Crescentia, fled to Lucania and then to Rome, 
                where he freed Emperor Diocletian's son of an evil spirit. When Vitus would not sacrifice to the gods, 
                his cure was attributed to sorcery.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                He, Modestus, and Crescentia were subjected to various tortures from which they emerged unscathed, 
                and were freed when during a storm, temples were destroyed and an angel guided them back to Lucania, 
                where they eventually died.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                So much for the legend. What is fact is that their cult goes back centuries and that they were Christians 
                who were martyred in Lucania. A great devotion to Vitus developed in Germany when his relics were translated to Saxony in 836.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Vitus is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, a group of saints venerated together in the Catholic Church 
                for their powerful intercession. His cult developed significantly in Germany when his relics were translated to Saxony in 836, 
                spreading his devotion throughout Europe.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Youthful Faith</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Vitus represents the power of youthful faith and the courage to stand firm in one's beliefs even in the face of persecution. 
                His conversion at the age of twelve and his subsequent miracles demonstrate that age is no barrier to holiness 
                and that God can work through anyone, regardless of their youth.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Protector and Healer</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As patron of epileptics and those afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (named after him), St. Vitus continues to be invoked 
                for healing and protection. His association with dancers and actors also makes him a patron of the performing arts, 
                reminding us that all forms of human expression can be sanctified.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Guardian Against Storms</h3>
              <p>
                St. Vitus is also known as a protector against storms, a patronage that likely stems from the legend of the storm 
                that destroyed pagan temples and led to his liberation. This aspect of his patronage reminds us of God's power 
                over nature and His protection of the faithful.

                On this day, many Catholics pray for those suffering from epilepsy and neurological disorders, as well as for
