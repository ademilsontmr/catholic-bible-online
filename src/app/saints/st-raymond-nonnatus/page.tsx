              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Raymond Nonnatus was born at Portella, Catalonia, Spain, in the early 13th century. 
                His birth was truly miraculous - he was delivered by caesarean operation when his mother 
                died in childbirth, hence his name "Nonnatus" which means "not born" in Latin.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Despite the tragic circumstances of his birth, Raymond miraculously survived the ordeal. 
                This extraordinary beginning marked the start of a life dedicated to God and the service 
                of others, particularly those in need of liberation and protection.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Raymond joined the Mercedarians under St. Peter Nolasco at Barcelona, dedicating himself 
                to the order's mission of ransoming Christian slaves from Muslim captivity. He succeeded 
                Peter as chief ransomer and traveled to Algeria to ransom slaves, demonstrating great 
                courage and compassion in his missionary work.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During his mission in Algeria, Raymond remained as a hostage for several slaves when his 
                money ran out. He was sentenced to be impaled when the governor learned that he had 
                converted several Muslims to Christianity. He escaped the death sentence because of the 
                ransom he would bring, but was forced to run the gauntlet and was tortured for continuing 
                his evangelizing activities.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After eight months of captivity and torture, Raymond was finally ransomed by Peter Nolasco. 
                On his return to Barcelona in 1239, he was appointed Cardinal by Pope Gregory IX, but died 
                at Cardona, a short distance from Barcelona, the next year while on his way to Rome. 
                He was canonized in 1657.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Raymond Nonnatus is remembered not only for his miraculous birth and missionary zeal, 
                but also for his unwavering faith and dedication to the liberation of others, both 
                physically and spiritually.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Raymond's legacy is one of miraculous survival, missionary courage, and compassionate 
                service. His life demonstrates that even the most difficult beginnings can lead to great 
                holiness and service to God and others.

              <p className="mb-6">
                As a Mercedarian missionary, St. Raymond exemplified the courage and dedication needed 
                to serve in dangerous territories. His willingness to risk his life for the liberation 
                of others shows the depth of his love for Christ and his neighbor.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Due to the miraculous nature of his own birth, St. Raymond became the patron saint of 
                expectant mothers and midwives. His intercession is sought by women during pregnancy 
                and childbirth, as well as by those who assist in the birthing process.

                St. Raymond's work with the Mercedarians established him as a powerful intercessor for 
                those who are captive, whether physically, spiritually, or emotionally. His example 
                inspires us to work for the liberation of all who are oppressed.
