              <p className="mb-6">
                Anne Marguerite Adelaide Emily de Vialar was the eldest child and only daughter of Baron James Augustine de Vialar 
                and his wife Antoinette, daughter of that Baron de Portal who was physician-in-ordinary to Louis XVIII and Charles X of France. 
                She was born at Gaillac in Languedoc in 1797.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                At the age of fifteen she was removed from school in Paris to be companion to her father, now a widower, at Gaillac; 
                but unhappily, differences arose between them because of Emily's refusal to consider a suitable marriage.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                For fifteen years, Emily was the good angel of Gaillac, devoting herself to the care of children neglected by their parents 
                and to the help of the poor generally. In 1832, her maternal grandfather died, leaving her a share of his estate 
                which was a quite considerable fortune.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                She bought a large house at Gaillac and took possession of it with three companions. Others joined them and three months later, 
                the archbishop authorized the Abbe to clothe twelve postulants with the religious habit. They called themselves 
                the Congregation of Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Their work was to be the care of the needy, especially the sick, and the education of children. In 1835, she made her profession 
                with seventeen other sisters, and received formal approval for the rule of the Congregation.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Emily de Vialar represents the power of a single woman's determination to serve God and the poor. Her life demonstrates 
                that even in the face of family opposition and personal suffering, one can achieve great things for the Kingdom of God 
                through faith, perseverance, and love.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Foundress of a Religious Congregation</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                The foundress, in the course of twenty-two years, saw her Congregation grow from one to some forty houses, 
                many of which she had founded in person. Her vision of serving the needy, especially the sick, and educating children 
                continues to inspire the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition today.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Charity and Service</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                For fifteen years before founding her congregation, Emily was known as "the good angel of Gaillac," caring for neglected children 
                and helping the poor. Her commitment to charity, even at the cost of her own health, shows her deep love for Christ 
                in the least of His brothers and sisters.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Witness to Perseverance</h3>
              <p>
                The physical energy and achievements of St. Emily de Vialar are the more remarkable in that from her youth she was troubled by hernia, 
                contracted characteristically in doing a deed of charity. Despite her suffering, she continued her mission until her death, 
                leaving her daughters with the simple but profound testament: "Love one another."
