                Saints Joachim (sometimes spelled "Joaquin," pronounced "wal-keem") and Anne are the parents of the Virgin Mary. There are no mentions of them in the Bible or Gospels; what we know comes from Catholic legend and the Gospel of James, which is an unsanctioned, apocryphal writing from the second century AD.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                We do know from scholarship that the Gospel of James was not written by James, the Brother of Jesus, despite its claim to be so authored. Even the early Church fathers expressed skepticism about the Gospel of James in their writings. There are about 150 copies of the ancient manuscript which often have different titles, but tell the same story, that Mary was promised to Joachim and Anne by an angel, was consecrated to God, and she remained a virgin all her life.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Naturally, there is plenty of room for scholarly debate about these saints. We have no true primary sources that prove they even existed, but certainly we can agree that Mary had parents. Likewise, we can agree that Mary had good, faithful parents who raised her with a love and devotion to God like none other except Jesus Christ Himself.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Joachim and Anne serve as role models for parents and both deserve to be honored and emulated for their devotion to God and Our Lady Mary, the Mother of God.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Sts. Joachim and Anne serve as the ultimate model for Christian parents. They raised the Blessed Virgin Mary, the most perfect human being ever created, preparing her for her unique role as the Mother of God. Their parenting must have been extraordinary to produce such a holy and virtuous daughter.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Despite the lack of historical documentation, the Church honors Joachim and Anne for their faith and devotion to God. They are believed to have been righteous and God-fearing people who lived according to the Jewish law and traditions, preparing the way for the coming of the Messiah through their daughter Mary.

                As the grandparents of Jesus Christ, Joachim and Anne hold a unique place in salvation history. They are part of the Holy Family tree and share in the mystery of the Incarnation. Their role in preparing Mary for her divine motherhood makes them instrumental in God's plan of salvation.
