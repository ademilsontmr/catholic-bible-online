                St. John, the beloved disciple, was one of the twelve apostles chosen 
                by Jesus Christ and holds a unique place among them. Jesus particularly 
                loved St. John, probably because of his great innocence and purity. 
                This special relationship with Christ is evident throughout the Gospels, 
                where John is often referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. John was the son of Zebedee and Salome, and the brother of St. 
                James the Greater. Together with his brother and St. Peter, John 
                formed the inner circle of Jesus' disciples, being present at the 
                most important moments of Jesus' ministry, including the Transfiguration 
                and the Agony in the Garden.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                One of the most significant moments in St. John's life occurred at 
                the foot of the Cross, where Jesus entrusted His blessed Mother to 
                John's care, saying, "Woman, behold your son," and to John, "Behold 
                your mother." From that hour, John took Mary into his home, fulfilling 
                this sacred trust and becoming the spiritual son of the Mother of God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. John is the author of the Fourth Gospel, three Epistles, and 
                the Book of Revelation. His Gospel is unique among the four Gospels 
                for its theological depth and emphasis on the divinity of Christ. 
                It begins with the profound prologue, "In the beginning was the Word, 
                and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," establishing the 
                eternal nature of Christ.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, St. John remained 
                in Jerusalem for some time, caring for the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
                Later, he went to Ephesus, where he established a Christian community 
                and served as its bishop. According to tradition, he was the only 
                apostle who did not die a martyr's death, though he did suffer persecution 
                and exile to the island of Patmos.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. John lived to an advanced age, dying peacefully in Ephesus around 
                the year 100 AD. His long life allowed him to witness the growth 
                of the early Church and to provide guidance to the Christian communities 
                through his writings and teachings. His emphasis on love as the central 
                message of Christianity earned him the title "Apostle of Love."

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. John's most distinctive legacy is his unique relationship with 
                Jesus as "the disciple whom Jesus loved." This special bond demonstrates 
                the personal nature of Christ's love for each of His followers and 
                shows that God's love is not generic but deeply personal and individual. 
                John's example teaches us that we are all beloved by Christ and that 
                our relationship with Him should be characterized by intimacy and trust.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Guardian of the Blessed Virgin</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. John's role as the guardian of the Blessed Virgin Mary represents 
                one of the most sacred trusts given to any human being. By accepting 
                this responsibility, John became the spiritual son of the Mother 
                of God and established a model for devotion to Mary that would inspire 
                countless Christians throughout history. His care for Mary demonstrates 
                the importance of honoring and protecting the sacred in our lives.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Apostle of Love</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. John's writings emphasize love as the central message of Christianity. 
                His famous statement, "God is love," and his repeated exhortations 
                to love one another have made him known as the Apostle of Love. His 
                legacy teaches us that love is not just a feeling but the very essence 
                of Christian life and the foundation of all authentic relationships.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Theological Vision</h3>
              <p>
                St. John's Gospel and other writings provide the most profound theological 
                insights into the nature of Christ and the Christian life. His emphasis 
                on the divinity of Christ, the importance of the Eucharist, and the 
                role of the Holy Spirit has shaped Christian theology for two millennia. 
                His Book of Revelation provides a vision of the ultimate triumph of 
                good over evil and the fulfillment of God's plan for creation.
