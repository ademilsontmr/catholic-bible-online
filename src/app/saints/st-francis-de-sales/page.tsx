              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francis de Sales was born to a noble family at Chateau de Sales in the Kingdom of Savoy near Geneva, Switzerland on August 21, 1567. He was a Bishop and Doctor of the Church, known for his gentle approach to spirituality and his famous book "Introduction to the Devout Life."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Francis was both intelligent and gentle. From a very early age, he desired to serve God. He knew for years he had a vocation to the priesthood, but kept it from his family. His father wanted him to enter a career in law and politics. In 1580, Francis attended the University of Paris, and at 24-years-old, he received his doctorate in law at the University of Padua.
              </p>
              <p>
                God made his will clear to Francis one day while he was riding. Francis fell from his horse three times that day. Every time he fell, the sword came out of the scabbard, and every time it came out, the sword and scabbard came to rest on the ground in the shape of the Christian cross. After much discussion and disagreement from his father, Francis was ordained to the priesthood and elected provost of the Diocese of Geneva in 1593.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Francis de Sales left a legacy of gentleness, patience, and the universal call to holiness. His most famous book, "Introduction to the Devout Life," was written for ordinary lay people in 1608, not just the clergy and religious. It became an instant success all over Europe.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Gentleness</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                During the Protestant reformation, Francis lived close to Calvinist territory. He decided to lead an expedition to bring the 60,000 Calvinists back to the Catholic Church. For three years, he trudged through the countryside, had doors slammed in his face and rocks thrown at him. His unusual patience kept him working, and he found a way to get under the door by writing little pamphlets to explain true Catholic doctrine.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Universal Call to Holiness</h3>
              <p>
                Francis insisted that every Christian was called to holiness and sanctity, lived within their own state in life. He laid the groundwork for the teaching of the Second Vatican Council on what is now called the universal call to holiness. He gave spiritual direction to lay people who were living real lives in the real world.
