              <p className="mb-6">
                The first act of the apostles after the Ascension of Jesus was to find a replacement for Judas. With all the questions, 
                doubts, and dangers facing them, they chose to focus their attention on finding a twelfth apostle. Twelve was a very 
                important number to the Chosen People: twelve was the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. If the new Israel was 
                to come from the disciples of Jesus, a twelfth apostle was needed.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Peter had one criterion: that, like Andrew, James, John, and himself, the new apostle be someone who had been a disciple 
                from the very beginning, from his baptism by John until the Ascension. The reason for this was simple - the new apostle 
                would must become a witness to Jesus' resurrection. He must have followed Jesus before anyone knew him, stayed with him 
                when he made enemies, and believed in him when he spoke of the cross and of eating his body.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Two men fit this description -- Matthias and Joseph called Barsabbas. They knew that both these men had been with them 
                and with Jesus through his whole ministry. But which one had the heart to become a witness to his resurrection? 
                The apostles knew that only the Lord could know what was in the heart of each. They cast lots in order to discover 
                God's will and Matthias was chosen.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                That's the first we hear of Matthias in Scripture, and the last. Legends like the Acts of Andrew and Matthias testify 
                to Matthias' enthusiastic embrace of all that being an apostle meant including evangelization, persecution, and death 
                in the service of the Lord.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Clement of Alexandria says that Matthias, like all the other apostles, was not chosen by Jesus for what he already was, 
                but for what Jesus foresaw he would become. He was elected not because he was worthy but because he would become worthy. 
                Jesus chooses all of us in the same way.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Divine Election</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Matthias represents the mystery of divine election and the completion of God's plan. His selection through the 
                casting of lots shows that God's will can be discerned through prayer and trust in divine providence, even when 
                human reasoning cannot determine the best choice.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Witness to the Resurrection</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As one who had been with Jesus from the beginning of his ministry, Matthias was uniquely qualified to be a witness 
                to the resurrection. His life reminds us that true apostleship requires not just knowledge of Jesus, but intimate 
                experience of his life, death, and resurrection.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Symbol of Completeness</h3>
              <p>
                Matthias completed the twelve apostles, symbolizing the completeness of the new Israel. His addition to the apostolic 
                college shows that God's plan is never incomplete, and that He always provides what is needed for the fulfillment 
                of His divine purposes.

                St. Matthias is celebrated on May 14th, a date that falls during the Easter season, fitting for one who was chosen 
                to be a witness to the resurrection. This feast day reminds us of the importance of apostolic witness and the 
                call to evangelization.

              <p className="mb-6">
                On this day, many Catholics reflect on their own call to be witnesses to Christ and to complete whatever mission 
                God has given them. It's also a day to pray for the grace to be chosen by God for His purposes, even when 
                we feel unworthy or like latecomers.

              <p>
                The feast day is an excellent time to pray for the grace to become worthy of God's call, to be witnesses to 
                the resurrection, and to embrace our role in completing God's plan for the Church.
