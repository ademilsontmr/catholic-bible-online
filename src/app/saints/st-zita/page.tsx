              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Zita was born into a poor but holy Christian family. Her older sister became a Cistercian nun and her uncle Graziano was a hermit whom the local people regarded as a saint. Zita herself always tried to do God's will obediently whenever it was pointed out to her by her mother.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                At the age of twelve Zita became a housekeeper in the house of a rich weaver in Lucca, Italy, eight miles from her home at Monte Sagrati. As things turned out, she stayed with that family for the last forty-eight years of her life. She found time every day to attend Mass and to recite many prayers, as well as to carry out her household duties so perfectly that the other servants were jealous of her.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Indeed, her work was part of her religion! She used to say: "a servant is not holy if she is not busy; lazy people of our position is fake holiness." At first, her employers were upset by her generous gifts of food to the poor, but in time, they were completely won over by her patience and goodness and she became a very close friend.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Zita was given a free reign over her working schedule and busied herself with visits to the sick and those in prison. Word spread rapidly in Lucca of her good deeds and the heavenly visions that appeared to her. She was sought out by the important people, and at her death in 1278 the people acclaimed her as a saint.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                She is the patroness of domestic workers. Her feast day is April 27.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Zita's legacy demonstrates that holiness can be achieved in the most ordinary of circumstances. Her life as a domestic worker shows that God calls people to sanctity in every walk of life, not just in religious vocations. She teaches us that our daily work, no matter how humble, can be a path to holiness when done with love and dedication to God.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Patroness of Domestic Workers</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As the patroness of domestic workers, St. Zita continues to inspire millions of people who work in homes and service industries around the world. Her example reminds us that all honest work has dignity and value in God's eyes. She shows that service to others, even in the most menial tasks, can be a form of worship and a way to serve Christ.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Balance of Work and Prayer</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Zita's ability to balance her demanding work schedule with her spiritual life serves as a model for all Christians. She found time every day for Mass and prayer while still performing her duties perfectly. Her famous saying about busy servants being holy teaches us that idleness is not a virtue and that God calls us to be productive and diligent in our work.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Charity and Generosity</h3>
              <p>
                St. Zita's generosity to the poor, even when it initially upset her employers, demonstrates the importance of charity in the Christian life. Her patience and goodness eventually won over those around her, showing that living the Gospel authentically can convert hearts. Her ministry to the sick and imprisoned shows that love of neighbor extends beyond our immediate family and workplace.
