              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Margaret of Cortona was born in Loviana, Tuscany, in 1247, the daughter of a small farmer. 
                Her mother died when she was only seven years old, and her stepmother showed little care for her 
                high-spirited daughter. Rejected at home, Margaret's life took a tragic turn when she eloped with 
                a youth from Montepulciano and bore him a son out of wedlock.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                For nine years, Margaret lived with her lover in a relationship that was not blessed by the Church. 
                However, her life changed dramatically when her lover was murdered without warning. This tragic event 
                became the catalyst for her conversion. Margaret left Montepulciano and returned as a penitent to 
                her father's house, seeking forgiveness and a new beginning.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                When her father refused to accept her and her son, Margaret found refuge with the Friars Minor at Cortona. 
                Despite finding asylum, Margaret struggled with overcoming the temptations of the flesh. Her journey of 
                repentance was not easy, and she faced many internal battles. One Sunday, she returned to Loviana with 
                a cord around her neck, publicly asking pardon for her past scandal during Mass.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In her deep remorse, Margaret even attempted to mutilate her face, but was restrained by Friar Giunta, 
                who became her spiritual director. Under his guidance, Margaret began to earn a living by nursing sick 
                ladies, and later gave this up to serve the sick poor without recompense, subsisting only on alms.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Eventually, Margaret joined the Third Order of St. Francis, and her son also joined the Franciscans 
                a few years later. She advanced rapidly in prayer and was said to be in direct contact with Jesus, 
                experiencing frequent ecstasies. Friar Giunta recorded many of the messages she received from God, 
                which were not all related to herself, and she courageously presented these messages to others.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Margaret's legacy is one of extraordinary conversion, deep repentance, and selfless charity. She exemplifies 
                the power of God's mercy and the possibility of transformation through genuine contrition and penance.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Repentance</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As a penitent who overcame a sinful past, St. Margaret provides a perfect model of true repentance. She shows us that 
                no matter how far we have fallen, God's mercy is always available to those who sincerely seek forgiveness and are 
                willing to make amends for their past actions.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Charity and Service</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Margaret's dedication to serving the sick poor without recompense demonstrates the Christian virtue of charity 
                in its purest form. She founded hospitals, established the Confraternity of Our Lady of Mercy, and created the 
                congregation known as "The Poverelle" (The Poor Ones), showing that true conversion leads to acts of love.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Mystical Union with Christ</h3>
              <p>
                St. Margaret's frequent ecstasies and direct communication with Jesus demonstrate the depth of her spiritual life. 
                Her mystical experiences, recorded by Friar Giunta, show that God can work through even the most broken vessels 
                when they surrender themselves completely to His will.

                The feast of St. Margaret of Cortona is celebrated on February 22nd, commemorating her death in 1297. 
                This day serves as a reminder of the power of repentance and the mercy of God, who can transform

                On this feast day, Catholics are encouraged to reflect on the sacrament of reconciliation, practice 
                acts of penance, and reach out to those who may feel unworthy of God's mercy. It's also a time to 
                pray for single mothers and those struggling with past sins.
              </p>

              <p>
                The feast of St. Margaret reminds us that God's mercy is boundless and that no one is beyond redemption. 
                It's an excellent time to pray for the intercession of this great penitent saint and to renew our 
                commitment to living a life of repentance and charity.
