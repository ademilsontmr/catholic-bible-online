          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Aloysius was born in Castiglione, Italy. The first words St. Aloysius spoke were the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. 
                He was destined for the military by his father (who was in service to Philip II), but by the age of 9 Aloysius had decided 
                on a religious life, and made a vow of perpetual virginity.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                To safeguard himself from possible temptation, he would keep his eyes persistently downcast in the presence of women. 
                St. Charles Borromeo gave him his first Holy Communion. A kidney disease prevented St. Aloysius from a full social life 
                for a while, so he spent his time in prayer and reading the lives of the saints.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Although he was appointed a page in Spain, St. Aloysius kept up his many devotions and austerities, and was quite resolved 
                to become a Jesuit. His family eventually moved back to Italy, where he taught catechism to the poor.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                When he was 18, he joined the Jesuits, after finally breaking down his father, who had refused his entrance into the order. 
                He served in a hospital during the plague of 1587 in Milan, and died from it at the age of 23, after receiving the last rites 
                from St. Robert Bellarmine.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The last word he spoke was the Holy Name of Jesus. St. Robert wrote the Life of St. Aloysius.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Aloysius Gonzaga represents the possibility of achieving great holiness even at a young age. His life demonstrates 
                that youth is not a barrier to sanctity, and that young people can make profound spiritual commitments and live them 
                with extraordinary dedication.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Aloysius's vow of perpetual virginity at the age of 9 and his practice of keeping his eyes downcast in the presence 
                of women show his extraordinary commitment to purity. His example continues to inspire young people to live chaste lives 
                in a world that often challenges these values.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Jesuit Spirituality</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As a Jesuit, St. Aloysius embodied the Society of Jesus's commitment to education, service, and spiritual formation. 
                His dedication to prayer, his service to the poor through catechism, and his willingness to serve during the plague 
                demonstrate the Jesuit ideal of being "contemplatives in action."

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Patron of Youth and Students</h3>
              <p>
                St. Aloysius's patronage of youth and students stems from his own experience as a young person seeking holiness 
                and his dedication to education and formation. His life teaches young people that they can make a difference 
                in the world through their faith and commitment to God.
