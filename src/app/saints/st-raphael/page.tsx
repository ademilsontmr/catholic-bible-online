                St. Raphael is one of the seven Archangels who stand before the throne 
                of the Lord, and one of the only three mentioned by name in the Bible. 
                He appears, by name, only in the Book of Tobit. Raphael's name means 
                "God heals." This identity came about because of the biblical story 
                that claims he "healed" the earth when it was defiled by the sins of 
                the fallen angels in the apocryphal book of Enoch. Disguised as a human 
                in the Book of Tobit, Raphael refers to himself as "Azarias the son 
                of the great Ananias" and travels alongside Tobit's son, Tobiah. Once 
                Raphael returns from his journey with Tobiah, he declares to Tobit 
                that he was sent by the Lord to heal his blindness and deliver Sarah, 
                Tobiah's future wife, from the demon Asmodeus. It is then that his 
                true healing powers are revealed and he makes himself known as "the 
                angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord" Tobit 12:15.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The demon Asmodeus killed every man Sarah married on the night of the 
                wedding, before the marriage could be consummated. Raphael guided Tobiah 
                and taught him how to safely enter the marriage with Sarah. Raphael 
                is credited with driving the evil spirit from Sarah and restoring Tobit's 
                vision, allowing him to see the light of Heaven and for receiving all 
                good things through his intercession. Although only the archangels Gabriel 
                and Michael are mentioned by name in the New Testament, the Gospel of 
                John speaks of the pool at Bethesda, where many ill people rested, awaiting 
                the moving of the water. "An angel of the Lord descended at certain 
                times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down 
                first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of 
                whatsoever infirmity he lay under" John 5:1-4. Because of the healing 
                powers often linked to Raphael, the angel spoken of is generally associated 
                with St. Raphael, the Archangel.

                St. Raphael is the patron saint of travelers, the blind, bodily ills, 
                happy meetings, nurses, physicians and medical workers. He is often 
                pictured holding a staff and either holding or standing on a fish. 
                His feast day is celebrated on September 29, along with St. Michael 
                and St. Gabriel. Raphael's role as a guide and healer in the Book of 
                Tobit has made him one of the most beloved and invoked archangels in 
                the Catholic tradition, particularly for those seeking healing, guidance 
                on journeys, or protection from evil spirits.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Raphael's most enduring legacy is his role as the Archangel of 
                Healing, a title that reflects his name's meaning "God heals" and his 
                powerful intercession for physical, spiritual, and emotional healing. 
                His miraculous healing of Tobit's blindness and his deliverance of 
                Sarah from the demon Asmodeus demonstrate his extraordinary power to 
                bring about healing and restoration. Raphael's association with the 
                healing pool at Bethesda in the Gospel of John further establishes 
                his role as a divine instrument of God's healing grace. Throughout 
                Christian history, countless people have turned to St. Raphael for 
                healing from various ailments, both physical and spiritual. His legacy 
                reminds us that God is the ultimate healer and that He often works 
                through His angels to bring about healing and restoration in our lives. 
                Raphael's example encourages us to trust in God's healing power and 
                to seek His intercession when we or our loved ones are in need of healing.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Raphael's role as a guide and companion to Tobiah on his journey 
                has made him the patron saint of travelers and all those who are on 
                a journey, whether physical or spiritual. His protection and guidance 
                ensured Tobiah's safe return and successful marriage, demonstrating 
                his ability to watch over those who are traveling and to guide them 
                to their destination. Raphael's example encourages us to trust in God's 
                guidance in our own life journeys and to seek His protection when we 
                are traveling or facing new challenges. His patronage of travelers 
                reminds us that we are all on a journey through life and that we need 
                God's guidance and protection along the way. Raphael's legacy encourages 
                us to be open to God's guidance and to trust that He will lead us safely 
                through the challenges and difficulties we face in life.

              <p>
                St. Raphael's victory over the demon Asmodeus and his protection of 
                Sarah demonstrate his power to protect against evil and to deliver 
                people from demonic influence. His role as one of the seven archangels 
                who stand before the throne of God gives him special authority to combat 
                evil and to protect God's people. Raphael's example reminds us that 
                we are not alone in our spiritual battles and that God has provided 
                powerful protectors in the form of His archangels. His legacy encourages 
                us to call upon his intercession when we are facing spiritual difficulties 
                or when we feel threatened by evil influences. Raphael's protection 
                reminds us that God is always with us and that He has provided powerful 
                allies to help us in our spiritual journey.
