              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Joan of Arc was born around 1412 in Domr√©my, a small village in northeastern France. 
                She was the daughter of Jacques d'Arc, a farmer, and Isabelle Rom√©e. From an early age, 
                Joan was deeply religious and spent much of her time in prayer and attending Mass.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                At the age of 13, Joan began to experience visions and hear voices that she believed 
                came from God. These heavenly messengers, including St. Michael the Archangel, St. 
                Catherine of Alexandria, and St. Margaret of Antioch, told her that she had been chosen 
                to help save France from English domination during the Hundred Years' War.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1429, at the age of 17, Joan convinced the local commander to provide her with an 
                escort to the French court at Chinon. There, she met with the Dauphin (future King 
                Charles VII) and convinced him of her divine mission. After being examined by theologians 
                who found no fault in her, she was given command of French troops.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Joan led the French army to several victories, including the liberation of Orl√©ans, 
                which earned her the title "The Maid of Orl√©ans." She was instrumental in the 
                coronation of Charles VII at Reims Cathedral, fulfilling her mission to restore 
                the rightful king to the throne.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                However, Joan's military success was short-lived. In 1430, she was captured by 
                Burgundian forces and sold to the English. She was put on trial for heresy and 
                witchcraft, charges that were politically motivated. Despite her courageous defense, 
                she was found guilty and burned at the stake in Rouen on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Joan of Arc's legacy extends far beyond her military achievements. She represents 
                the power of faith, courage, and divine guidance in the face of seemingly impossible 
                odds. Her story has inspired countless people throughout history, both within and 
                outside the Catholic Church.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Joan's unwavering faith in God and her willingness to follow divine guidance, even 
                when it meant challenging social norms and facing persecution, serves as a powerful 
                example of spiritual courage. She demonstrated that God can work through anyone, 
                regardless of age, gender, or social status.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Her military leadership and strategic insight were remarkable for someone so young 
                and inexperienced. Joan's ability to inspire and lead troops, combined with her 
                deep faith, shows how spiritual conviction can translate into practical action and 
                positive change in the world.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Joan's martyrdom and the subsequent rehabilitation of her reputation demonstrate 
                the triumph of truth over false accusations and political manipulation. Her canonization 
                in 1920 by Pope Benedict XV affirmed her sanctity and recognized her as a model of 
                Christian virtue and courage.

                St. Joan of Arc's feast day is celebrated on May 30, the anniversary of her martyrdom 
                in 1431. This day commemorates not only her death but also her life of faith, courage, 
                and service to God and country.

              <p className="mb-6">
                In France, St. Joan of Arc is celebrated as a national heroine and patron saint. 
                Her feast day is marked with special Masses, processions, and cultural events, 
                particularly in Orl√©ans, where she liberated the city from English siege.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The feast day serves as a reminder of the importance of following God's call, 
                even when it requires great sacrifice. It also highlights the Church's recognition 
                of Joan's sanctity and her example of Christian virtue in the face of persecution.

                even when it means facing opposition and suffering.
