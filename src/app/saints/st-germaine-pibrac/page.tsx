          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6 text-center">📖 Life of St. Germaine of Pibrac</h2>
          
          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                When Hortense decided to marry Laurent Cousin in Pibrac, France, it 
                was not out of love for his infant daughter. Germaine was everything 
                Hortense despised. Weak and ill, the girl had also been born with 
                a right hand that was deformed and paralyzed. Hortense replaced the 
                love that Germaine had lost when her mother died with cruelty and abuse.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Laurent, who had a weak character, pretended not to notice that Germaine 
                had been given so little food that she had learned to crawl in order 
                to get to the dog's dish. He wasn't there to protect her when Hortense 
                left Germaine in a drain while she cared for chickens -- and forgot 
                her for three days. He didn't even interfere when Hortense poured 
                boiling water on Germaine's legs.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                With this kind of treatment, it's no surprise that Germaine became 
                even more ill. She came down with a disease known as scrofula, a kind 
                of tuberculosis that causes the neck glands to swell up. Sores began 
                to appear on her neck and in her weakened condition she fell prey 
                to every disease that came along. Instead of awakening Hortense's 
                pity this only made her despise Germaine more for being even uglier 
                in her eyes.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Germaine found no sympathy and love with her siblings. Watching their 
                mother's treatment of their half-sister, they learned how to despise 
                and torment her, putting ashes in her food and pitch in her clothes. 
                Their mother found this very entertaining.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Hortense did finally get concerned about Germaine's sickness -- because 
                she was afraid her own children would catch it. So she made Germaine 
                sleep out in the barn. The only warmth Germaine had on frozen winter 
                nights was the woolly sheep who slept there too. The only food she 
                had were the scraps Hortense might remember to throw her way.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The abuse of Germaine tears at our hearts and causes us to cry for 
                pity and justice. But it was Germaine's response to that abuse and 
                her cruel life that wins our awe and veneration.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Germaine was soon entrusted with the sheep. No one expected her to 
                have any use for education so she spent long days in the field tending 
                the sheep. Instead of being lonely, she found a friend in God. She 
                didn't know any theology and only the basics of the faith that she 
                learned from the catechism. But she had a rosary made of knots in 
                string and her very simple prayers: "Dear God, please don't let me 
                be too hungry or too thirsty. Help me to please my mother. And help 
                me to please you." Out of that simple faith, grew a profound holiness 
                and a deep trust of God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                And she had the most important prayer of all -- the Mass. Every day, 
                without fail, she would leave her sheep in God's care and go to Mass. 
                Villagers wondered that the sheep weren't attacked by the wolves in 
                the woods when she left but God's protection never failed her. One 
                day when the rains had swollen the river to flood stage, a villager 
                saw the river part so that she could cross to get to the church in 
                time for Mass.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                No matter how little Germaine had, she shared it with others. Her 
                scraps of food were given to beggars. Her life of prayer became stories 
                of God that entranced the village children.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                But most startling of all was the forgiveness she showed to the woman 
                who deserved her hatred. Hortense, furious at the stories about her 
                daughter's holiness, waited only to catch her doing wrong. One cold 
                winter day, after throwing out a beggar that Germaine had let sleep 
                in the barn, Hortense caught Germaine carrying something bundled up 
                in her apron. Certain that Germaine had stolen bread to feed the beggar, 
                she began to chase and scream at the child.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                As she began to beat her, Germaine opened her apron. Out tumbled what 
                she had been hiding in her apron -- bright beautiful flowers that 
                no one had expected to see for months. Where had she found the vibrant 
                blossoms in the middle of the ice and snow? There was only one answer 
                and Germaine gave it herself, when she handed a flower to her mother 
                and said, "Please accept this flower, Mother. God sends it to you 
                in sign of his forgiveness."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As the whole village began to talk about this holy child, even Hortense 
                began to soften her feelings toward her. She even invited Germaine 
                back to the house but Germaine had become used to her straw bed and 
                continued to sleep in it. There she was found dead at the age of 22, 
                overcome by a life of suffering.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Germaine's most remarkable legacy is her extraordinary capacity 
                for forgiveness. Despite enduring years of horrific abuse from her 
                stepmother and siblings, she never harbored hatred or resentment. 
                Her ability to forgive those who had caused her such suffering demonstrates 
                the power of divine grace to transform even the most painful experiences 
                into opportunities for holiness.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Germaine's life story has made her a powerful advocate for abused 
                children throughout the world. Her experience of suffering and her 
                ultimate triumph through faith provides hope and comfort to children 
                who are experiencing similar situations. She shows that even in the 
                darkest circumstances, God's love and protection are always present.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Simple Faith and Holiness</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Germaine's holiness was not achieved through theological study 
                or religious education, but through simple, childlike faith and trust 
                in God. Her prayers were simple and direct, her devotion to the Mass 
                unwavering, and her love for God expressed through her care for others. 
                She demonstrates that sanctity is accessible to everyone, regardless 
                of education or social status.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Miraculous Incorruption</h3>
              <p>
                When her body was exhumed forty years after her death, it was found 
                to be undecayed, what is known as incorruptible. This miracle, combined 
                with the stories of her holiness that began to circulate, led to her 
                canonization. The incorruption of her body serves as a sign that God 
                chooses not the outwardly beautiful to preserve, but those who are 
                beautiful in His eyes through their humility and love.

                appropriate as St. Germaine's life exemplifies the love and forgiveness
