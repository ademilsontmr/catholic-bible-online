                St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux was born Marie-Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se Martin on January 2, 1873, in Alen√ßon, 
                France. She was the youngest of nine children born to Louis and Z√©lie Martin, both of whom 
                are now canonized saints. From an early age, Th√©r√®se showed a deep love for God and a desire 
                to become a saint.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Th√©r√®se's mother died when she was only four years old, and the family moved to Lisieux. 
                At the age of 15, she entered the Carmelite convent in Lisieux, taking the religious name 
                Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. Despite her young age, she was determined 
                to give herself completely to God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In the convent, Th√©r√®se lived a life of great simplicity and humility. She developed what 
                she called her "Little Way" - a path to holiness through small, everyday acts of love and 
                sacrifice. She believed that even the smallest actions, when done with love for God, could 
                lead to great holiness.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Th√©r√®se suffered from tuberculosis and died on September 30, 1897, at the age of 24. Before 
                her death, she promised to spend her heaven doing good on earth and to let fall a shower 
                of roses. She was canonized in 1925 by Pope Pius XI, and in 1997, Pope John Paul II declared 
                her a Doctor of the Church, making her the youngest person and only the third woman to receive 
                this honor.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Th√©r√®se's autobiography, "Story of a Soul," has become one of the most beloved spiritual 
                books in the Catholic Church. Her "Little Way" continues to inspire millions of people around 
                the world to find holiness in the ordinary moments of daily life.

                St. Th√©r√®se's most enduring legacy is her "Little Way" - a simple path to holiness that 
                anyone can follow. She taught that we don't need to do great things to become saints; 
                instead, we should do small things with great love. This approach to spirituality has 
                made holiness accessible to ordinary people everywhere.

                As a Doctor of the Church, St. Th√©r√®se's teachings have been recognized as having universal 
                value for the Church. Her insights into the spiritual life, particularly her understanding 
                of God's mercy and love, continue to guide theologians and spiritual writers today.

                St. Th√©r√®se showed us how to approach God with the trust and simplicity of a child. She 
                believed that God is a loving Father who wants to give us everything we need. Her example 
                teaches us to trust in God's love and to rely on His mercy rather than our own strength.

                of roses has made her one of the most popular saints for intercession. Countless people 
                have experienced her help and have received roses as a sign of her intercession. She 
                continues to be a powerful advocate for all who turn to her in prayer.

                The feast of St. Th√©r√®se is celebrated on October 1st, the day after her death. This date 
                marks the beginning of the month of the Holy Rosary, making it a fitting time to honor 
                this great saint who had such a deep devotion to Mary. The feast is celebrated as a 
                memorial throughout the Church.

              <p className="mb-6">
                On St. Th√©r√®se's feast day, many people participate in the "Rose Novena" - nine days of 
                prayer asking for her intercession. Some churches hold special Masses and prayer services, 
                and many people visit shrines dedicated to St. Th√©r√®se. It's also traditional to give 
                roses to others as a sign of love and to practice small acts of kindness.
              </p>

              <p>
                The feast day is an excellent time to pray the Novena to St. Th√©r√®se, the Prayer to St. Th√©r√®se, 
                or to read her autobiography "Story of a Soul." Many people also make a special effort to 
                practice her "Little Way" by doing small acts of love and sacrifice throughout the day.
