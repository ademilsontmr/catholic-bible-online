          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                Blessed Rose was born at Viterbo in 1656, the daughter of Godfrey Venerini, 
                a physician. Her early life was marked by personal tragedy when a young man 
                who had been paying court to her died, leading her to enter a convent. However, 
                after a few months, she had to return home to look after her widowed mother, 
                which would prove to be a turning point in her life and vocation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During this time at home, Rose used to gather the women and girls of the 
                neighborhood to say the rosary together in the evenings. When she discovered 
                how ignorant many of them were of their religion, she began to instruct them. 
                This simple act of gathering neighbors for prayer and instruction would become 
                the foundation of her life's work in education and evangelization.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                She was directed by Father Ignatius Martinelli, a Jesuit, who convinced her 
                that her vocation was as a teacher "in the world" rather than as a contemplative 
                in a convent. This spiritual guidance would prove crucial in shaping her 
                mission. In 1685, with two helpers, Rose opened a preschool for girls in 
                Viterbo, which soon became a success and marked the beginning of her 
                educational apostolate.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Blessed Rose had the gift of ready and persuasive speech, and a real ability 
                to teach and to teach others to teach. She was not daunted by any difficulty 
                when the service of God was in question. Her reputation spread, and in 1692, 
                she was invited by Cardinal Barbarigo to advise and help in the training of 
                teachers and organizing of schools in his diocese of Montefiascone.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Here she was the mentor and friend of Lucy Filippini, who became foundress 
                of an institute of maestre pie and was canonized in 1930. Rose organized a 
                number of schools in various places, sometimes in the face of opposition 
                that resorted to force in unbelievable fashion - the teachers were shot at 
                with bows and their house fired. Her patience and trust overcame all obstacles.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1713, she made a foundation in Rome that received the praise of Pope 
                Clement XI himself. It was in Rome that she died on May 7, 1728. Her 
                reputation of holiness was confirmed by miracles, and in 1952, she was 
                beatified. It was not until sometime after her death that Blessed Rose's 
                lay school teachers were organized as a religious congregation: they are 
                found in America as well as in Italy, for the Venerini Sisters have worked 
                among Italian immigrants since early in the twentieth century.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Revolutionary Educator</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Blessed Rose Venerini's legacy is most profoundly marked by her revolutionary 
                approach to education, particularly for girls. At a time when formal education 
                for girls was rare and often discouraged, she recognized the importance of 
                educating young women in both academic subjects and religious formation. Her 
                preschool in Viterbo was not just a school but a center of Christian formation 
                that would shape the lives of countless young women and, through them, their 
                families and communities. This aspect of her legacy continues to inspire 
                educators today to see their work as a form of evangelization and to recognize 
                the importance of educating the whole person - mind, body, and soul.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Founder of Religious Congregation</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Though Blessed Rose herself was a laywoman, her work laid the foundation for 
                what would become the Venerini Sisters, a religious congregation dedicated to 
                education. Her vision of education as a form of Christian service and her 
                methods of teaching others to teach would be carried forward by the sisters 
                who followed in her footsteps. The congregation's work among Italian immigrants 
                in America shows how her legacy has transcended national boundaries and continues 
                to serve the Church in new contexts. This aspect of her legacy demonstrates 
                how the work of one person can multiply and spread far beyond their immediate 
                circumstances.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Courageous Faith</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Blessed Rose's willingness to face opposition and even violence for the sake 
                of her educational mission demonstrates her courageous faith and commitment 
                to God's work. The fact that teachers in her schools were shot at with bows 
                and their houses fired shows the level of resistance she faced. Yet her 
                patience and trust in God overcame all obstacles. This aspect of her legacy 
                continues to inspire those who face opposition in their work for the Gospel 
                and reminds us that true Christian service often requires courage and 
                perseverance in the face of adversity.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Mentor and Spiritual Guide</h3>
              <p>
                Blessed Rose's role as mentor to St. Lucy Filippini shows her ability to 
                recognize and nurture the gifts of others. Her guidance helped St. Lucy 
                become a foundress in her own right, demonstrating how one person's holiness 
                can inspire and enable the holiness of others. This aspect of her legacy 
                continues to remind us of the importance of spiritual mentorship and the 
                responsibility we have to help others discover and develop their God-given 
                talents. Her example shows that true leadership is not about building 
                personal empires but about empowering others to serve God in their own 
                unique ways.

                serving God. It's also a day to reflect on the importance of education 
                as a form of evangelization and the role of women in the Church's educational
