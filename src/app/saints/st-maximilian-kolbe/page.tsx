              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Maximilian Kolbe was born Raymond Kolbe on January 8, 1894, in Zdunska Wola, Poland, 
                to a poor but devout Catholic family. From an early age, he showed a deep love for the 
                Blessed Virgin Mary and a desire to serve God. At the age of 12, he had a vision of the 
                Virgin Mary offering him two crowns - one white for purity and one red for martyrdom - 
                and he chose both.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1907, Raymond entered the Franciscan Order and took the name Maximilian. He was ordained 
                a priest in 1918 and became known for his deep devotion to the Immaculate Conception and 
                his missionary zeal. He founded the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate) and 
                established the monastery of Niepokalan√≥w near Warsaw, which became a center for Catholic 
                publishing and evangelization.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In 1930, Maximilian traveled to Japan where he founded another monastery and began publishing 
                a Japanese version of his magazine. He returned to Poland in 1936 and continued his work 
                at Niepokalan√≥w, which grew to become the largest Franciscan monastery in the world, 
                housing over 700 friars.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                During World War II, Maximilian was arrested by the Nazis and sent to Auschwitz concentration 
                camp. In July 1941, when a prisoner escaped, the Nazis selected ten men to be starved to death 
                as punishment. When one of the selected men, Franciszek Gajowniczek, cried out for his family, 
                Maximilian stepped forward and offered to take his place. He was starved for two weeks and 
                then killed by lethal injection on August 14, 1941. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II 
                on October 10, 1982, and his feast day is celebrated on August 14th.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Maximilian Kolbe's greatest legacy is his ultimate sacrifice of love - giving his life 
                for another person. His act of volunteering to die in place of Franciszek Gajowniczek 
                exemplifies the Gospel teaching that "greater love has no one than this, that someone lay 
                down his life for his friends." He is often called the "Martyr of Charity" because he 
                died not for his faith, but for love of his neighbor.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Devotion to the Immaculate Conception</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Maximilian's deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and his promotion of the Immaculate 
                Conception continue to inspire Catholics today. He founded the Militia Immaculatae, which 
                has spread throughout the world, and his writings on Marian devotion remain influential. 
                His example shows how devotion to Mary can lead to greater love for Christ and others.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Evangelization</h3>
              <p>
                Maximilian's use of modern media for evangelization - through his magazines and radio 
                broadcasts - was ahead of his time. He showed that the Church can and should use every 
                available means to spread the Gospel. His work at Niepokalan√≥w demonstrated how a 
                community dedicated to Mary can become a powerful force for good in the world.

                The feast of St. Maximilian Kolbe is celebrated on August 14th, the anniversary of his 
                martyrdom at Auschwitz. This date falls during the summer season, a time of warmth and 
                light, which is fitting for a saint whose life was a beacon of hope and love in the 
                darkness of war and hatred. The feast is celebrated as a memorial throughout the Church.
