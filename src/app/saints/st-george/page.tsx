              <p className="mb-6">
                St. George was born in the late 3rd century in Cappadocia (modern Turkey) 
                to a noble Christian family. His father was a Roman army officer, and 
                George followed in his footsteps, joining the Roman military and rising 
                to the rank of tribune in the imperial guard. He served under Emperor 
                Diocletian, who was known for his persecution of Christians.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Despite his high position in the Roman army, George was a devout Christian 
                who refused to participate in the persecution of his fellow believers. 
                When Diocletian issued an edict requiring all soldiers to offer sacrifices 
                to the Roman gods, George publicly declared his Christian faith and refused 
                to comply. This act of courage led to his arrest and imprisonment.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During his imprisonment, George endured various forms of torture, including 
                being stretched on a wheel of swords and being thrown into a pit of quicklime. 
                Despite these sufferings, he remained steadfast in his faith. According to 
                tradition, he was miraculously healed from his wounds, which led to the 
                conversion of many witnesses, including the emperor's wife, Empress Alexandra.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. George was eventually beheaded for his faith around 303 AD in Lydda 
                (modern Lod, Israel). His martyrdom became a powerful witness to the 
                Christian faith, and he was quickly venerated as a saint. The most famous 
                legend associated with him - the slaying of the dragon - emerged later 
                and symbolizes his victory over evil and his protection of the innocent. 
                His feast day is celebrated on April 23rd.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. George's greatest legacy is his role as the patron saint of England. 
                His popularity in England began during the Crusades, when English soldiers 
                adopted him as their patron. King Edward III founded the Order of the 
                Garter under St. George's patronage in 1348, and his feast day became 
                a major celebration in England. The St. George's Cross (a red cross on 
                a white background) became the flag of England and is still used today.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Symbol of Courage and Chivalry</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                The legend of St. George slaying the dragon has made him a universal 
                symbol of courage, chivalry, and the triumph of good over evil. This 
                story, while not historical, represents his spiritual victory over 
                persecution and his willingness to defend the innocent. The dragon 
                symbolizes evil, sin, and persecution, while George represents the 
                Christian knight who fights for truth and justice.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Christian Witness</h3>
              <p>
                St. George's martyrdom serves as a powerful example of Christian witness 
                and faithfulness in the face of persecution. His willingness to die 
                rather than renounce his faith inspired countless Christians throughout 
                history. He shows that true courage comes from faith in God and that 
                standing up for what is right may require great sacrifice.

                The feast of St. George is celebrated on April 23rd, during the spring 
                season. This date falls during the Easter season, a time of renewal and 
                victory, which is fitting for a saint whose life symbolizes the triumph 
                of faith over persecution. The feast is celebrated as a solemnity in 
                England and as a memorial throughout the Church.

              <p className="mb-6">
                On St. George's feast day, England celebrates with parades, pageants, 
                and the flying of the St. George's Cross. Many churches hold special 
                services, and some people wear red roses (England's national flower) 
                in his honor. Military units and organizations dedicated to St. George 
                hold special ceremonies and celebrations.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Prayer and Devotion</h3>
              <p>
                The feast day is an excellent time to pray the Prayer to St. George, 
                the Prayer for Soldiers, or to make a special petition for courage 
                and protection. Many people also visit churches dedicated to St. George 
                or make pilgrimages to his shrine in Lydda, Israel.
