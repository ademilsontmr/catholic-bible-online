                This American saint was born in Bohemia in 1811. He was looking forward to being ordained in 1835 when the bishop 
                decided there would be no more ordinations. It is difficult for us to imagine now, but Bohemia was overstocked with priests. 
                John wrote to bishops all over Europe but the story was the same everywhere - no one wanted any more priests.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                But John didn't give up. He had learned English by working in a factory with English-speaking workers so he wrote to the bishops in America. 
                Finally, the bishop in New York agreed to ordain him. In order to follow God's call to the priesthood John would have to leave his home forever 
                and travel across the ocean to a new and rugged land.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                In New York, John was one of 36 priests for 200,000 Catholics. John's parish in western New York stretched from Lake Ontario to Pennsylvania. 
                His church had no steeple or floor but that didn't matter because John spent most of his time traveling from village to village, 
                climbing mountains to visit the sick, staying in garrets and taverns to teach, and celebrating the Mass at kitchen tables.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Because of the work and the isolation of his parish, John longed for community and so joined the Redemptorists, 
                a congregation of priests and brothers dedicated to helping the poor and most abandoned.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                John was appointed bishop of Philadelphia in 1852. As bishop, he was the first to organize a diocesan Catholic school system. 
                A founder of Catholic education in this country, he increased the number of Catholic schools in his diocese from two to 100.

                St. John Neumann represents the immigrant experience and the determination to follow God's call despite overwhelming obstacles. 
                His journey from Bohemia to America, his perseverance in seeking ordination, and his tireless missionary work demonstrate 
                that God's plans often require great sacrifice and trust.

              <p className="mb-6">
                As the first bishop to organize a diocesan Catholic school system in the United States, St. John Neumann laid the foundation 
                for Catholic education in America. His vision of increasing Catholic schools from two to 100 in his diocese shows his 
                commitment to forming young minds in the faith.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Humility and Service</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                John never lost his love and concern for the people, something that may have bothered the elite of Philadelphia. 
                His willingness to travel in a manure wagon, his simple lifestyle with only one pair of shoes, and his ability to 
                learn multiple languages to serve diverse communities show his true pastoral heart.

              <p>
                As a Redemptorist priest, St. John Neumann embodied the congregation's charism of serving the poor and most abandoned. 
                His missionary zeal, his dedication to the sacraments, and his tireless pastoral work continue to inspire priests 
                and religious today.

                St. John Neumann is celebrated on January 5th, the date of his death in 1860. This feast day is particularly

                On this day, many Catholics pray for Catholic schools, for immigrant communities, and for those discerning 
                priestly vocations. It's also a day to celebrate the contributions of immigrants to the American Church 
                and to give thanks for Catholic education.
