                Untrustworthy sources say he was probably born at <strong>Montpellier, France</strong>, son of the governor there. He was orphaned when he was twenty. He went on pilgrimage to Rome and devoted himself to caring for the victims of a plague that was ravaging Italy. He became a victim himself at Piacenza but recovered and was reputed to have performed many miracles of healing.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                On his return to Montpellier, he was imprisoned for five years as a spy in pilgrim's disguise when his uncle, who was governor, ordered him imprisoned. His uncle failed to recognize him, and Roch failed to identify himself. Roch died in prison and was only then identified as the former governor's son by a birthmark in the form of a cross on his chest.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Another biographer says that he was arrested as a spy at Angers, Lombardi, and died in prison there. When miracles were reported at his intercession after his death, a popular cult developed and he is invoked against pestilence and plague. He is also the patron of invalids.

              <p>
                He is known as <strong>Rocco</strong> in Italy and <strong>Roque</strong> in Spain. His feast day is August 16th.

                St. Roch's legacy is primarily associated with miraculous healing, particularly during times of plague and pestilence. His own recovery from the plague at Piacenza, followed by his reputation for performing many miracles of healing, established him as a powerful intercessor for those suffering from illness and disease.

                Despite being a nobleman's son, Roch chose to devote himself to caring for plague victims in Italy, putting his own life at risk. His selfless service to the sick and suffering, even after becoming a victim himself, demonstrates the Christian virtue of charity and compassion for those in need.

                The circumstances of his death and subsequent identification through the cross-shaped birthmark on his chest add a mystical element to his story. This miraculous identification after death helped establish his cult and led to his widespread veneration as a saint.
