          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Camillus de Lellis was born in 1550 at Bocchianico, Italy. His early life was marked by 
                military service and personal struggles. He fought for the Venetians against the Turks and 
                developed an addiction to gambling, which left him penniless in Naples by 1574.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After hitting rock bottom, Camillus experienced a profound conversion and attempted to become 
                a Capuchin novice. However, he was unable to be professed due to a diseased leg he had contracted 
                while fighting the Turks. This physical limitation would later become the foundation of his 
                ministry to the sick.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Instead of giving up, Camillus devoted himself to caring for the sick and became the director 
                of St. Giacomo Hospital in Rome. His confessor, St. Philip Neri, recognized his calling and 
                gave him permission to be ordained. With two companions, Camillus founded his own congregation, 
                the Ministers of the Sick (later known as the Camellians), dedicated specifically to the care 
                of the sick.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The new congregation began ministering to the sick at Holy Ghost Hospital in Rome, and their 
                work quickly expanded. They enlarged their facilities in 1585, founded a new house in Naples 
                in 1588, and courageously attended to the plague-stricken aboard ships in Rome's harbor and 
                throughout the city.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1591, Pope Gregory XIV officially recognized the Congregation as an order to serve the sick. 
                In 1591 and 1605, Camillus sent members of his order to minister to wounded troops in Hungary 
                and Croatia, creating what is considered the first field medical unit. Despite being gravely 
                ill for many years, he continued his work until resigning as superior of the Order in 1607. 
                He died in Rome on July 14, 1614, the year after attending a General Chapter there.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Camillus de Lellis revolutionized the care of the sick by establishing the first religious 
                order specifically dedicated to healthcare ministry. His approach combined medical care with 
                spiritual comfort, recognizing that the sick need both physical and spiritual healing.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Conversion and Service</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Camillus's life demonstrates the power of conversion and redemption. From a gambling-addicted 
                soldier to a saintly healthcare worker, his transformation shows that God can use anyone's 
                past experiences and even their weaknesses to bring about great good.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Courage in Crisis</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                During plague outbreaks, Camillus and his companions showed extraordinary courage by caring 
                for the sick when others fled. They risked their own lives to provide both medical care and 
                spiritual comfort to those suffering from contagious diseases.

                Camillus's innovation in sending his order to care for wounded soldiers in Hungary and Croatia 
                established the foundation for military field medicine. This pioneering work continues to 
                influence how we care for the wounded in conflict zones.

                St. Camillus was canonized in 1746 by Pope Benedict XIV. His canonization recognized not only 
                his personal holiness but also the importance of his work in establishing healthcare ministry 
                as a vital part of the Church's mission.

                In today's world, St. Camillus's feast day serves as a reminder of the dignity of healthcare 
                work and the importance of combining medical care with spiritual care. It's a day to pray for 
                all healthcare workers and to remember the sick in our prayers.
