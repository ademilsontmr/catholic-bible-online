              <p className="mb-6">
                Saint Marianne Cope, also known as Saint Marianne of Moloka'i, was born on January 23, 
                1838, in Heppenheim, in what was then the Grand Duchy of Hesse (now part of Germany). 
                She was baptized Maria Anna Barbara Koob, which was later changed to Cope. Her life 
                would become a remarkable journey of service and compassion, particularly to those 
                suffering from leprosy in Hawaii.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Just a year after her birth, her family emigrated to the United States, settling in 
                Utica, New York. Cope attended a parish school until she reached the eighth grade. 
                By that time, her father had become an invalid and she went to work in a factory to 
                support the family. This early experience of caring for others would shape her future 
                vocation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Her father died in 1862, and this, along with her siblings' maturity, permitted her 
                to leave the factory to pursue a religious life. She became a novitiate of the Sisters 
                of the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis based in Syracuse, New York, taking the 
                name Marianne when she completed her formation. German-speaking immigrants settled in 
                large numbers in her area of New York state, so she became a teacher and later a 
                principal at a school for immigrant children.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Cope also helped direct the opening of the first two Catholic hospitals in central 
                New York. She arranged for students from the Geneva Medical College in New York to 
                work at the hospital, but also stipulated that patients should be able to refuse 
                treatment by them. It was one of the first times in history that the right of a 
                patient to refuse treatment was recognized, showing her commitment to patient dignity 
                and autonomy.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                By 1883, Cope had become the Superior General of her congregation. It was at this 
                time she received a plea for help from leprosy sufferers in Hawaii. King Kalakaua 
                himself sent the letter asking for aid in treating patients who were isolated on the 
                island of Moloka'i. The King had already been declined by more than 50 other religious 
                institutes. Mother Marianne, as she was then known, left Syracuse with six sisters 
                to attend to the sick, arriving on November 8, 1883.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Marianne's most enduring legacy is her pioneering work in healthcare in Hawaii. 
                She managed a hospital on the island of O'ahu where victims of leprosy were sent for 
                triage, and helped establish the Malulani hospital on the island of Maui. Her work 
                established the foundation for Catholic healthcare in the Hawaiian Islands and set 
                standards for compassionate care that continue to influence healthcare today.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Advocate for Patient Rights</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Marianne was ahead of her time in recognizing and advocating for patient rights. Her 
                insistence that patients should be able to refuse treatment was revolutionary for the 
                19th century and demonstrated her deep respect for human dignity. This principle of 
                patient autonomy has become a cornerstone of modern medical ethics and patient care.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Servant of the Most Marginalized</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Marianne's willingness to serve leprosy patients when more than 50 other religious 
                institutes had declined demonstrates her extraordinary courage and compassion. She 
                served not only the patients but also their orphaned children and clergy who had 
                contracted the disease. Her work with the most marginalized members of society 
                exemplifies the Gospel call to serve "the least of these."
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Perseverance</h3>
              <p>
                Despite being confined to a wheelchair in her later years, Marianne continued to 
                work tirelessly for those in need. Her frail body did not prevent her from serving 
                others, and many noticed that despite all her years of work with leprosy patients, 
                she never contracted the disease herself, which many regarded as a miracle. Her 
                perseverance in the face of physical limitations serves as an inspiration for all 
                who face challenges in their service to others.

                The feast of St. Marianne Cope is celebrated on January 23rd, her birthday. This 
                date commemorates her life of service and her dedication to caring for the most

              <p className="mb-6">
                Marianne was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on May 14, 2005, after a miraculous 
                cure from multiple organ failure was attributed to her intercession. On October 21, 
                2012, she was officially canonized by Pope Benedict XVI, becoming the first 
                Franciscan woman from North America to be canonized. Her canonization recognized 
                her extraordinary service to the poor and sick.

              <p>
                In today's world, St. Marianne's feast day serves as a reminder of the importance 
                of serving the most vulnerable members of society. It's a day to reflect on how we 
                can reach out to those who are marginalized or suffering, and to remember that 
                every person, regardless of their condition, deserves dignity and compassionate care.
