              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Louise de Marillac was born on August 12, 1591, probably at Ferrieres-en-Brie near Meux, France. 
                She was educated by the Dominican nuns at Poissy, where she received a solid foundation in both 
                academic and spiritual formation. From an early age, Louise felt a strong calling to religious life 
                and desired to become a nun.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                However, following the advice of her confessor, she married Antony LeGras, an official in the Queen's 
                service, in 1613. This marriage, though not her first choice, became an important part of her spiritual 
                journey. Louise embraced her role as a wife and mother, learning valuable lessons about love, sacrifice, 
                and service within the context of family life.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After Antony's death in 1625, Louise found herself a widow with new responsibilities and challenges. 
                It was during this difficult period that she met St. Vincent de Paul, who became her spiritual adviser 
                and would profoundly influence the rest of her life. Under his guidance, Louise discovered her true 
                vocation and devoted herself completely to serving God through works of charity.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Louise began working closely with St. Vincent de Paul, helping to direct his Ladies of Charity in 
                their work of caring for the sick, the poor, and the neglected. Her organizational skills, compassion, 
                and deep spiritual insight made her an invaluable partner in this ministry. She understood that true 
                charity required both love and practical organization.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1633, Louise set up a training center in her own home for candidates seeking to help in her work. 
                This was the beginning of the Sisters (or Daughters, as Vincent preferred) of Charity of St. Vincent 
                de Paul, though it was not formally approved until 1655. Louise took her vows in 1634 and attracted 
                great numbers of candidates who were drawn to her example of selfless service and deep spirituality.

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Louise's legacy is one of extraordinary charity, organizational genius, and spiritual depth. She 
                exemplifies how lay people, especially widows, can serve God and neighbor through practical works of 
                mercy while maintaining a deep interior life.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Model of Organized Charity</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Louise revolutionized the way charity was practiced by combining practical organization with genuine 
                love. She wrote a rule for the community and established systematic approaches to serving the poor, 
                showing that effective charity requires both heart and structure. Her methods became the foundation 
                for modern social work.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Co-founder of Daughters of Charity</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                As co-founder of the Daughters of Charity with St. Vincent de Paul, Louise created a new model of 
                religious life that allowed women to serve the poor while living in the world. She traveled all over 
                France establishing her Sisters in hospitals, orphanages, and other institutions, creating a network 
                of charity that continues to this day.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Patroness of Social Workers</h3>
              <p>
                Declared Patroness of Social Workers by Pope John XXIII in 1960, St. Louise represents the ideal 
                of professional service combined with Christian love. Her life shows that social work, when done 
                with faith and love, becomes a form of ministry and a path to holiness.

                The feast of St. Louise de Marillac is celebrated on March 15th, commemorating her death in Paris 
                in 1660. This day honors her as a model of Christian widowhood and organized charity, reminding us 
                that every state of life can be a path to holiness when lived in service to God and neighbor.

                On this feast day, Catholics are encouraged to reflect on how they can serve the poor and marginalized 
                in their communities. It's also a time to pray for social workers, widows, and all those who dedicate 
                their lives to serving others. Many parishes organize service projects or charitable activities.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Prayer and Devotion</h3>
              <p>
                The feast of St. Louise reminds us that charity is not just about giving, but about organizing and 
                sustaining works of mercy. It's an excellent time to pray for the intercession of this great saint 
                and to renew our commitment to serving the poor with both love and practical wisdom.
