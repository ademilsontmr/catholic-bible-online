              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Peregrine Laziosi was born in 1260 in Forl√¨, Italy, into a wealthy family. As a young man, 
                he was involved in politics and was a member of the anti-papal faction. During a riot against 
                the Pope's representatives, Peregrine struck St. Philip Benizi, the Prior General of the Servite Order, 
                in the face. However, instead of retaliating, St. Philip turned the other cheek, which deeply 
                moved Peregrine and led to his conversion.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                After his conversion, Peregrine joined the Servite Order and became a model of penance and prayer. 
                He lived a life of strict austerity, sleeping on the floor and fasting frequently. He was known 
                for his deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and his compassion for the poor and sick.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The most famous aspect of St. Peregrine's life is the miraculous healing of his leg. He developed 
                a severe infection in his leg that was diagnosed as cancer. The doctors recommended amputation, 
                but the night before the surgery, Peregrine prayed before a crucifix and had a vision of Jesus 
                descending from the cross to touch his leg. The next morning, his leg was completely healed, 
                with no trace of the cancer.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Peregrine died on May 1, 1345, at the age of 85. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII 
                in 1726. His feast day is celebrated on May 1st, and he is particularly venerated by those 
                suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses.
