      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Parents acknowledges the sacred responsibility that God has entrusted to parents. This Catholic prayer recognizes that children are gifts from God and that parents have the privilege and duty to raise them in faith and love. The prayer asks for the virtues that are essential for good parenting: wisdom, patience, and strength.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that parenting is a vocation, a calling from God. Parents are the first teachers of faith to their children, and they have the responsibility to create a home where children can learn to know, love, and serve God. The prayer reminds us that our children belong to God first, and we are merely stewards of these precious gifts.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Parents also helps parents to grow in holiness themselves. By praying for the grace to be good parents, parents are also asking God to help them become better Christians. The prayer teaches us that the love we show our children should reflect the unconditional love that God has for us.
