      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        The Apostles' Creed is one of the most ancient and important statements of Christian faith. 
        While not written by the Apostles themselves, it summarizes the essential beliefs that the 
        Apostles taught and that have been passed down through the centuries. This creed serves as 
        a foundation for our Catholic faith and is recited during the Rosary and other devotions.

            I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, 
            born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; 
            he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, 
            and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge 
            the living and the dead.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-8">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Apostles' Creed developed gradually in the early Church as a way to summarize the essential 
          teachings of the Christian faith. While tradition holds that each of the twelve Apostles 
          contributed one article to the creed, it actually evolved over several centuries as the Church 
          sought to articulate its core beliefs clearly and defend them against various heresies.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The earliest form of the creed appeared in the 2nd century, and it reached its final form 
          in the 8th century. It was used for baptismal instruction and as a statement of faith for 
          new converts. Today, it remains one of the most widely accepted statements of Christian belief 
          across different denominations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Apostles' Creed is divided into three main sections, each focusing on one Person of the 
          Holy Trinity. When we recite this creed, we are not just repeating words—we are making a 
          personal declaration of our faith in the God who has revealed Himself to us through Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The first section affirms our belief in God the Father as the creator of all things. This 
          reminds us that everything we have comes from God and that we are called to be good stewards 
          of His creation. The second section, the longest, focuses on Jesus Christ and His saving work. 
          It recounts the key events of His life, death, and resurrection, showing us that our salvation 
          is rooted in historical events that really happened.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The third section speaks of the Holy Spirit and the Church. It reminds us that we are not 
          alone in our faith journey—we are part of a community of believers (the communion of saints) 
          and that God continues to work through His Church to bring forgiveness and new life to all people.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Comparison with the Nicene Creed</h2>
      
      <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          While the Apostles' Creed is shorter and more concise, the Nicene Creed (used at Mass) 
          is more detailed and was developed to address specific theological controversies. Both creeds 
          express the same essential Christian beliefs, but the Nicene Creed provides more theological 
          precision, especially regarding the nature of Christ and the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The Apostles' Creed is often preferred for personal prayer and devotions because of its 
          simplicity and directness, while the Nicene Creed is used in the liturgy to emphasize 
          the unity of the Church's faith.
