      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        The Litany of the Saints is a powerful prayer that invokes the intercession of the saints in heaven. 
        This litany is often prayed during important liturgical celebrations, such as the Easter Vigil, 
        ordinations, and other solemn occasions. It reminds us of the communion of saints and our connection 
        with those who have gone before us in faith.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Litany of the Saints is a powerful reminder of the communion of saints - the spiritual bond that unites 
          all the faithful, both living and dead, in Christ. Through this litany, we acknowledge that we are not alone 
          in our journey of faith.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The saints are our brothers and sisters in Christ who have gone before us and now intercede for us in heaven. 
          They are examples of holiness and virtue, showing us how to live as faithful disciples of Christ.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This litany also reminds us of our own call to holiness. The saints were ordinary people who, through God's grace, 
          became extraordinary examples of faith, hope, and love. Through their intercession, we can grow in these same virtues 
          and become saints ourselves.
