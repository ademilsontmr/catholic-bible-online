      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        The Our Father, also known as the Lord's Prayer, is the prayer that Jesus Himself taught to His disciples. 
        It serves as the perfect model for all Christian prayer, encompassing praise, petition, and surrender to God's will. 
        This Catholic prayer remains the foundation of our spiritual life and daily communication with our Heavenly Father.

      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Our Father is more than just words to recite‚Äîit's a blueprint for living in relationship with God. 
          When we call God "Our Father," we acknowledge our identity as His beloved children and our connection to all humanity as brothers and sisters in Christ.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The first part of this Catholic prayer focuses on God's glory and kingdom, teaching us to prioritize His will above our own desires. 
          "Give us this day our daily bread" reminds us to trust in God's providence and to be content with what we need rather than what we want.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The prayer's emphasis on forgiveness is particularly powerful‚Äîwe ask God to forgive us as we forgive others, 
          recognizing that our capacity to receive mercy is directly linked to our willingness to extend it. 
          This prayer guides us to live with humility, trust, and love, transforming our hearts to reflect the heart of Christ.
