      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        The Act of Contrition is a prayer that expresses our sorrow for sin and our commitment to avoid sin in the future. 
        This prayer is essential for the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) and is also used in daily prayer 
        to express our repentance and desire for God's mercy. It helps us to examine our conscience and turn back to God 
        with a contrite heart.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Act of Contrition is more than just a prayer—it's an expression of our heart's true sorrow for sin. 
          When we pray this prayer sincerely, we acknowledge that we have offended God, not just broken rules or 
          hurt others, but have wounded our relationship with the One who loves us most.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The prayer has three essential elements: sorrow for sin, resolution to avoid sin, and trust in God's mercy. 
          True contrition comes from love of God rather than fear of punishment. We are sorry not just because we 
          might be punished, but because our sins offend the God who is "all good and deserving of all my love."
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The prayer also includes a firm resolution to avoid sin in the future. This doesn't mean we will never sin again, 
          but it shows our sincere intention to cooperate with God's grace to grow in holiness. We ask for God's help 
          because we know we cannot overcome sin on our own.
        </p>
