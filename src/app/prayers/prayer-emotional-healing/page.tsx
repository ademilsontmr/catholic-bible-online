      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Emotional Healing acknowledges that emotional wounds can be just as painful and debilitating as physical wounds, and that God desires to heal every aspect of our being. This Catholic prayer recognizes that our emotions are a gift from God and that He wants us to experience the fullness of joy and peace that He offers. When we pray for emotional healing, we are surrendering our pain to God and trusting in His power to restore our hearts.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that emotional healing often involves forgivenessâ€”both of others and of ourselves. When we hold onto anger, resentment, or guilt, we prevent ourselves from experiencing the fullness of God's love and peace. The prayer reminds us that God's love is greater than any hurt we have experienced and that He can bring good out of even the most painful situations.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Emotional Healing also helps us to grow in empathy and compassion for others who are suffering emotionally. When we experience God's healing in our own lives, we become better able to offer comfort and support to others who are hurting. The prayer teaches us that we are all called to be instruments of God's healing love, reaching out to those who are emotionally wounded with compassion and care.
