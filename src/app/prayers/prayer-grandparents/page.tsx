      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Grandparents acknowledges the special role that grandparents play in the family and in passing on the faith. This Catholic prayer recognizes that grandparents are a bridge between generations, sharing wisdom, love, and faith with their grandchildren. The prayer asks for God's blessing on their health, happiness, and continued ability to be a blessing to their families.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us to honor and respect our elders, as Scripture commands. Grandparents often have a unique ability to share their faith and life experiences with their grandchildren in a way that parents cannot. They can provide stability, wisdom, and unconditional love that helps children grow in faith and character. The prayer reminds us that grandparents are a gift from God and should be cherished and cared for.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Grandparents also helps families to grow in gratitude and respect for the elderly. When we pray for our grandparents, we are acknowledging their importance in our lives and asking God to help us honor them as He commands. The prayer teaches us that the elderly have much to teach us about faith, love, and life, and that we should value their wisdom and experience.
