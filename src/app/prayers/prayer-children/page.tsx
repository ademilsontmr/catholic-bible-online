          The Prayer for Children is a powerful way to entrust our little ones to God's loving care. This Catholic prayer acknowledges that children are precious gifts from God and asks for His protection and guidance in their lives. When we pray for children, we are recognizing that they belong to God first, and we are asking Him to watch over them.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that children are not just our responsibility, but also God's beloved children. By praying for them, we are asking God to help us in our role as caregivers and to provide the grace and strength that children need to grow in faith and holiness. The prayer reminds us that our children's spiritual well-being is just as important as their physical well-being.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Children also helps us to grow in trust and faith. When we entrust our children to God's care, we are learning to let go of our worries and to trust in God's providence. The prayer teaches us that God loves our children even more than we do, and He will always watch over them and guide them in His ways.
