      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Advent is a time of spiritual preparation that calls us to reflect on the three comings of Christ: 
          His historical birth in Bethlehem, His coming into our hearts through grace, and His future coming in glory.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Advent season teaches us the virtue of waiting‚Äînot passive waiting, but active preparation. 
          Just as John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus, we are called to prepare our hearts and lives 
          to receive Christ more fully.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These prayers help us cultivate the spiritual dispositions that make us ready to welcome Jesus: 
          hope that sustains us in difficult times, peace that calms our anxieties, joy that lifts our spirits, 
          and love that transforms our relationships. Through prayer, we open ourselves to God's grace 
          and become more receptive to His presence in our lives.
