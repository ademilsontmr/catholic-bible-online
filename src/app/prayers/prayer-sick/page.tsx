      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Sick acknowledges that illness and suffering are part of the human condition, but that God is present in our suffering and desires to bring us healing and comfort. This Catholic prayer recognizes that God's healing can take many forms‚Äîphysical healing, emotional comfort, spiritual strength, or the grace to bear our suffering with patience and trust.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us to trust in God's providence and to believe in His power to heal. When we pray for the sick, we are not just asking for physical healing, but also for the grace to accept God's will and to find meaning in our suffering. The prayer reminds us that God is close to those who are suffering and that He hears our cries for help.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for the Sick also helps us to grow in compassion and empathy for those who are suffering. When we pray for others, we are reminded of our own vulnerability and our need for God's mercy. The prayer teaches us that we are all called to be instruments of God's healing love, visiting the sick and offering them comfort and support.
