      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for God's Love acknowledges that God's love is the foundation of our faith and the source of all good things in our lives. This Catholic prayer recognizes that God's love is unconditional, infinite, and unchanging—it doesn't depend on our performance or worthiness but flows from His very nature as love itself. When we pray this prayer, we are expressing gratitude for the greatest gift we could ever receive: the love of our Creator.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that God's love is demonstrated in countless ways—through creation, through His providence in our lives, through the gift of salvation, and through His constant presence with us. It reminds us that we are beloved children of God and that nothing can separate us from His love. The prayer helps us to rest in the security of God's affection and to find our identity in His love.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for God's Love also helps us to grow in our capacity to love others. When we regularly thank God for His love, we are reminded that we are called to be conduits of that same love to the world around us. The prayer teaches us that those who have experienced God's love should share that love with others, and that gratitude for God's love naturally leads to acts of love and service.
