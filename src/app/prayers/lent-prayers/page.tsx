        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Lent is a time of spiritual renewal and conversion, modeled after Jesus' forty days in the desert. 
          It calls us to examine our lives, repent of our sins, and grow closer to God through prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The three pillars of Lentâ€”prayer, fasting, and almsgivingâ€”help us to turn away from sin and turn toward God. 
          Prayer deepens our relationship with God, fasting helps us to master our desires and grow in self-discipline, 
          and almsgiving opens our hearts to the needs of others and reflects God's love.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These Lenten prayers guide us through this sacred season, helping us to prepare our hearts for Easter. 
          They remind us that Lent is not just about giving up something, but about growing in holiness and becoming 
          more like Christ. Through these prayers, we can experience true conversion and renewal of our spiritual lives.
