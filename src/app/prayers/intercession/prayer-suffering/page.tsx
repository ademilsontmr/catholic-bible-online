      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Suffering acknowledges that suffering is a reality of human life and that God does not abandon us in our pain. This Catholic prayer recognizes that Jesus himself experienced suffering and that through His passion and death, He transformed suffering into a means of redemption. When we pray for the suffering, we are asking God to bring comfort, healing, and meaning to those who are in pain.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that suffering, while difficult and often mysterious, can be united with Christ's suffering for the salvation of the world. The Catholic tradition speaks of redemptive sufferingâ€”the idea that our pain, when offered with faith and love, can contribute to the healing of the world. This doesn't mean that God causes suffering, but that He can bring good from even the most difficult circumstances.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for the Suffering also helps us to grow in compassion and to recognize our responsibility to care for those who are hurting. When we pray for the suffering, we are reminded that we are called to be instruments of God's healing love. This prayer challenges us to visit the sick, comfort the grieving, and advocate for better care for those who are vulnerable.
