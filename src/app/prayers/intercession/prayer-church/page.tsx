      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Church acknowledges that the Church is the mystical Body of Christ and that it needs our prayers to fulfill its mission in the world. This Catholic prayer recognizes that the Church is both divine and human—holy because it is Christ's Body, but also in need of constant purification and renewal because it is made up of sinful human beings. When we pray for the Church, we are supporting the community of faith that nourishes our spiritual lives.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that we are all part of the Church and that we have a responsibility to support it through our prayers, participation, and service. The Church faces many challenges in the modern world—secularization, scandal, division, and persecution in some places. Our prayers can provide spiritual support and ask for God's guidance in addressing these challenges.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for the Church also helps us to grow in our love for the Church and our commitment to its mission. When we pray for the Church, we are reminded that we are part of something larger than ourselves—a worldwide community of believers united in faith, hope, and love. This prayer encourages us to work for the Church's renewal and to support its mission of evangelization and service.
