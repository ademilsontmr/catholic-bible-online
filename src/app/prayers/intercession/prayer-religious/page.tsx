      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Religious acknowledges the special call that God gives to some people to dedicate their entire lives to Him through the religious life. This Catholic prayer recognizes that religious men and women are a gift to the Church and to the world, serving as living signs of God's love and witnesses to the values of the Gospel. When we pray for religious, we are supporting those who have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve God and others.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us to appreciate the important role that religious communities play in the Church and in society. Religious men and women serve in many ways‚Äîas teachers, nurses, social workers, missionaries, and contemplatives. Their lives of service, often in poverty and simplicity, remind us of what is truly important and challenge us to live more faithfully.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Religious also helps us to grow in our understanding of different vocations in the Church. When we pray for religious, we are reminded that God calls people in different ways and that all vocations are important for the life of the Church. This prayer encourages us to discern our own calling and to support others in living out their vocations faithfully.
