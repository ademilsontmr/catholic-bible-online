      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Poor acknowledges that God has a special love for the vulnerable and marginalized, and that we are called to care for them as expressions of our love for God. This Catholic prayer recognizes that poverty is not just a lack of material goods, but often involves a lack of dignity, opportunity, and hope. When we pray for the poor, we are asking God to provide for their needs and to inspire us to be instruments of His love and justice.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that our relationship with God is intimately connected to our relationship with the poor. Jesus taught us that whatever we do for the least of our brothers and sisters, we do for Him. The poor are not problems to be solved, but people to be loved and served. Our prayers for the poor should motivate us to concrete action‚Äîsharing our resources, advocating for justice, and working to address the root causes of poverty.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for the Poor also helps us to examine our own attitudes toward wealth and poverty. When we pray for the poor, we are reminded that all we have is a gift from God and that we are called to be good stewards of our blessings. This prayer challenges us to live more simply, to be generous with our resources, and to work for economic systems that serve the common good rather than just the wealthy.
