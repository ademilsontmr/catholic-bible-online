      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Missionaries acknowledges that the Great Commission given by Jesus to "go and make disciples of all nations" is still active today and that missionaries are the ones who carry out this sacred mandate. This Catholic prayer recognizes that missionary work requires great sacrifice, courage, and dedication, and that missionaries need our prayers to sustain them in their important work. When we pray for missionaries, we are supporting the spread of the Gospel throughout the world.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that evangelization is not just the work of professional missionaries, but the calling of every Catholic. We are all called to be missionaries in our own contexts‚Äîin our families, workplaces, and communities. The prayer for missionaries reminds us of our own responsibility to share the Good News and to support those who have made evangelization their life's work.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Missionaries also helps us to grow in our appreciation for the global nature of the Church and our unity with Catholics around the world. When we pray for missionaries, we are reminded that the Gospel is meant for all people and that the Church's mission extends to every corner of the earth. This prayer encourages us to support mission work through our prayers, financial gifts, and perhaps even by considering a missionary vocation ourselves.
