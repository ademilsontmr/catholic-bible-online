      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Healing acknowledges that we are all broken in some way and in need of God's healing touch. This Catholic prayer recognizes that healing is not just about physical recovery, but about the restoration of our whole beingâ€”body, mind, and spirit. When we pray for healing, we are surrendering our brokenness to God and trusting in His power to make us whole.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that God's healing can take many forms. Sometimes it means physical recovery, sometimes it means the grace to bear our suffering with patience, and sometimes it means finding peace and meaning in our pain. The prayer reminds us that God is always present in our suffering and that He desires to bring us healing and wholeness.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Healing also helps us to grow in trust and surrender. When we pray for healing, we are acknowledging that we cannot heal ourselves and that we need God's grace. The prayer teaches us that true healing comes from our relationship with God and that we can find peace even in the midst of suffering when we trust in His love and care.
