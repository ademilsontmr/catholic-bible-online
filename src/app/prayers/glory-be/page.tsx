      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        The Glory Be, also known as the Gloria Patri or the Lesser Doxology, is one of the most ancient and 
        beautiful prayers in the Christian tradition. This short but powerful prayer honors the Holy Trinity 
        and is used to conclude many other prayers, including the Rosary. It serves as a perfect expression 
        of praise to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-8">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Glory Be prayer has its roots in the early Church and was developed as a response to the Arian heresy, 
          which denied the divinity of Jesus Christ. The prayer affirms the equality and co-eternity of the three 
          Persons of the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This doxology has been used in Christian worship since at least the 4th century and is found in 
          various forms across different Christian traditions. The Catholic version emphasizes the eternal 
          nature of God's glory, which has no beginning and no end.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Glory Be is a prayer of pure praise and adoration. When we pray it, we acknowledge the majesty 
          and greatness of God in all three Persons. This prayer teaches us to give glory to God not just 
          for what He does, but for who He is—the eternal, unchanging, and all-powerful God.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The phrase "As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end" reminds us 
          that God's glory is eternal and unchanging. Unlike the created world, which has a beginning and 
          will have an end, God's glory transcends time and space. This gives us comfort and hope, knowing 
          that the same God who created the universe is with us now and will be with us forever.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This prayer also helps us to focus on the Trinity, the central mystery of our Christian faith. 
          By praying to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together, we acknowledge the unity and diversity 
          within the Godhead, and we participate in the eternal praise that the three Persons give to each other.
        </p>
