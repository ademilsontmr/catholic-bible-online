        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Home acknowledges that our home is more than just a physical dwelling‚Äîit is a sacred space where families grow in love and faith. This Catholic prayer recognizes that the home is the domestic church, where children first learn about God and where families gather to pray and worship together. The prayer asks for God's blessing and protection on this holy space.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that our home should be a reflection of God's love and a place where His presence is felt. By praying for our home, we are consecrating it to God and asking Him to make it a sanctuary of peace, love, and holiness. The prayer reminds us that our home should be a place where God is honored and where His love is shared with all who enter.
