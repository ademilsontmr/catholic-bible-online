      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for Family Protection acknowledges our dependence on God's loving care and protection. This Catholic prayer recognizes that we cannot protect ourselves or our loved ones from all the dangers and challenges of life, and so we turn to God, who is our ultimate protector and guardian. The prayer asks for both physical and spiritual protection, recognizing that our well-being involves both body and soul.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us to trust in God's providence and to find peace in His protection. When we pray for family protection, we are acknowledging that our family's safety is ultimately in God's hands, and we are asking Him to watch over us with His loving care. The prayer reminds us that God's protection is not just about keeping us safe from physical harm, but also about protecting us from spiritual dangers and keeping us close to Him.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for Family Protection also helps families to grow in faith and trust. When we entrust our safety to God, we are learning to rely on His love and care rather than on our own strength. The prayer teaches us that true security comes from our relationship with God and that we can find peace even in difficult circumstances when we trust in His protection.
