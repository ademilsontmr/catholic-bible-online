        The Hail Mary is one of the most beloved prayers in the Catholic tradition, combining the words of the Angel Gabriel 
        and Saint Elizabeth from the Gospel of Luke. This prayer honors the Blessed Virgin Mary and asks for her intercession, 
        recognizing her unique role as the Mother of God and our spiritual mother.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Hail Mary prayer is deeply rooted in Scripture. The first part comes from the Annunciation, 
          when the Angel Gabriel greeted Mary: "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you" (Luke 1:28). 
          The second part comes from Elizabeth's greeting to Mary: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb" (Luke 1:42).
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The third part, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death," 
          was added by the Church to ask for Mary's intercession. This reflects the Catholic belief that Mary, 
          as the Mother of God, has a special role in praying for us and bringing our petitions to her Son.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When we pray the Hail Mary, we join our voices with countless generations of Christians who have honored 
          the Blessed Virgin Mary. This prayer teaches us to recognize Mary's unique role in salvation history 
          and to seek her maternal intercession in our spiritual journey.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The prayer begins by acknowledging Mary's special grace and her close relationship with God. 
          We then honor her as the mother of Jesus, recognizing that through her "yes" to God, 
          salvation came into the world. Finally, we ask for her prayers, both in our daily struggles 
          and at the moment of our death.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Hail Mary is a prayer of humility and trust. It reminds us that we are sinners in need of God's mercy, 
          and that Mary, as our spiritual mother, is always ready to intercede for us. This prayer helps us 
          grow in devotion to Mary and, through her, to Jesus Christ.
        </p>
