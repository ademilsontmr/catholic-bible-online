      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Meaning and Reflection</h2>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Prayer for the Family acknowledges that the family is the domestic church, where children first learn about God and His love. This Catholic prayer recognizes that families are called to be witnesses of God's love in the world and asks for His grace to help them fulfill this mission. When families pray together, they strengthen their bonds and grow in holiness as a unit.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This prayer teaches us that the family is not just a social institution, but a divine gift that reflects the love of the Holy Trinity. By praying together, families create a sacred space where God's presence is felt and His grace is received. The prayer reminds us that our home should be a place where God is honored and where His love is shared with all who enter.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Prayer for the Family also helps families to grow in the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity. It teaches family members to trust in God's providence and to love one another as God loves us. When families make prayer a regular part of their daily routine, they create a strong foundation for a life of faith and become a beacon of God's love in the world.
