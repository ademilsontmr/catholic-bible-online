      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          All Souls Day reminds us of the reality of death and the hope of eternal life. It teaches us 
          that death is not the end, but a transition to a new life with God. Through our prayers, 
          we can help the souls in purgatory to be purified and to enter into the fullness of God's presence.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The doctrine of purgatory is a beautiful expression of God's mercy. It teaches us that even after death, 
          God continues to work for our salvation, purifying us of our sins so that we may be worthy to enter heaven. 
          Our prayers for the dead are acts of love and charity that can help them on their journey to eternal life.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These All Souls Day prayers help us to remember our loved ones who have died and to express our love 
          for them through prayer. They also remind us of our own mortality and the importance of living a holy life. 
          Through these prayers, we can grow in our understanding of the communion of saints and in our hope for eternal life.
