We ask that You would guide their hands, their minds, and their hearts as they work to provide the best possible care. Lord, You are the source of all wisdom, and we pray that You would pour out Your wisdom upon all those involved in the medical care of the sick.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Help us to trust in Your ability to guide medical professionals to make the right decisions and to provide the best treatments. Give us the faith to believe that You can work through medical science and human skill to bring healing and restoration. May Your wisdom guide every medical decision and every treatment plan.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray that You would help us to be grateful for the medical care that is available and for the skill and dedication of medical professionals. Give us the wisdom to appreciate the gifts and talents that You have given to doctors and nurses, and the gratitude to thank You for their service and care. May our gratitude inspire us to pray for them and to support them in their work.</p>

<p className="mb-4">We ask that You would help us to work in partnership with medical professionals, trusting in their expertise while also trusting in Your healing power. Give us the wisdom to know when to seek medical help, when to follow medical advice, and when to trust in Your direct intervention. May our partnership with medical professionals be a witness to Your wisdom and Your care.</p>

<p className="mb-4">We ask this through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
