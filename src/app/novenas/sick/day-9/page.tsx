We ask that You would work a miracle in their body, mind, and spirit that brings complete restoration and wholeness. Lord, You are the God of restoration, who makes all things new and brings beauty from ashes. We pray that You would work Your miraculous power in the sick person's life, bringing complete healing and restoration.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Help us to believe that You can and will bring complete healing, not just partial healing, but full and complete restoration in every aspect of the sick person's being. Give us the faith to trust in Your power to work miracles and the hope to believe that complete healing is possible. May their healing be a testimony to Your power and Your love, inspiring others to trust in You and to seek Your healing touch.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray that You would help us to be open to receiving Your complete healing in whatever way You choose to work it. Whether through prayer, through the sacraments, through medical treatment, or through Your direct intervention, help us to recognize and receive Your healing work. May we be like the people who witnessed Your miracles and gave glory to God.</p>

<p className="mb-4">We ask that You would help us to be a source of hope and encouragement to others who are seeking complete healing in their own lives. May the sick person's healing journey inspire and encourage those who may be struggling with similar health challenges. Help us to share the love and mercy that we have received from You, pointing others to Your healing power and Your desire for their complete restoration.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Let their complete healing be a witness to Your love and Your power to transform lives. We ask this through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
