We ask that You would wrap them in Your loving arms and fill them with Your peace that surpasses all understanding. Lord, You are the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions, and we pray that You would pour out Your comfort upon those who are suffering from illness.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Help us to trust in Your ability to provide comfort that goes beyond human understanding, knowing that You can bring peace even in the midst of pain and suffering. Give us the faith to believe that Your comfort can reach the deepest parts of the sick person's heart and soul, bringing them the peace and rest they need. May Your comfort be like a gentle balm that soothes their pain and calms their fears.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray that You would help us to be instruments of Your comfort to the sick. Give us the wisdom to know how to comfort them, the words to speak that bring peace, and the actions that demonstrate Your love and care. May we be channels of Your comfort, bringing Your peace and love to those who are suffering.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Help us to be patient and gentle, understanding that illness can make people feel vulnerable and afraid. We ask that You would help us to recognize and appreciate the comfort that You provide, even in small ways. Give us the ability to see Your hand at work in the care and support that surrounds the sick person, and the gratitude to thank You for every moment of comfort and peace.</p>

<p className="mb-4">May Your divine comfort be a witness to Your love and Your presence in the lives of the sick. We ask this through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
