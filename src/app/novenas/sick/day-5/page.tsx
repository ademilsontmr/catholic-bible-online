We ask that You would touch them with Your healing hand and remove all pain, discomfort, and suffering that they may be experiencing. Lord, You know every ache, every pain, every discomfort that the sick person feels, and we pray that You would bring them comfort and relief.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Help us to trust in Your ability to heal pain completely, knowing that You can remove suffering with a single word or touch. Give us the faith to believe that You desire the comfort and well-being of the sick person, and that You will bring relief in Your perfect timing. May Your healing touch bring immediate comfort and lasting relief from all physical pain.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray that You would help the sick person to offer up their pain and suffering in union with Your own suffering on the cross. Help them to find meaning and purpose in their suffering, even as we pray for relief. May their pain be transformed into a prayer and an offering that brings grace and healing to others who are suffering.</p>

<p className="mb-4">We ask that You would help us to be patient and trusting as we wait for Your healing touch. Give us the strength to endure any remaining pain with courage and faith, knowing that You are with us and working for our good. May the relief from pain be a witness to Your power and Your love, bringing glory to Your name.</p>

<p className="mb-4">We ask this through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
