                Today we pray for peace in your heart and in the world through Mary's intercession. 
                Peace is a gift from God that helps us to be calm and content, even in difficult circumstances.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary is called the Queen of Peace because her heart was always at peace. Even in the midst of great suffering, 
                she maintained her peace because her heart was completely focused on God and His will.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's peace came from her complete trust in God. She knew that He was in control and that He would bring good out of every situation. 
                This trust gave her a deep peace that nothing could disturb.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us find the peace that comes from knowing and loving God. 
                Let us ask her to help us trust in God completely and to find peace in His love.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that true peace is not the absence of problems, but the presence of God in our hearts. 
                When we have God in our hearts, we can have peace even in the midst of difficulties.
