                Conversion is a lifelong process. It's not just a one-time event, but a continuous turning toward God. 
                The Sacred Heart of Jesus has the power to convert even the hardest hearts, and He calls each of us 
                to ongoing conversion and repentance.

              <p className="mb-4">
                When we pray for conversion, we're not just praying for others, but also for ourselves. 
                We all need to be converted more deeply to Christ, to turn away from our sins, and to grow in holiness. 
                The Sacred Heart is always ready to help us in this process.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, examine your own heart and ask Jesus to help you identify areas where you need conversion. 
                Pray for the grace to turn away from sin and to turn toward Him more completely. 
                Also pray for those who are far from God, that they may experience His love and mercy.
