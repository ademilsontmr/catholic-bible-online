                Complete consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is not a one-time act, but a daily commitment. 
                It means allowing Jesus to guide every aspect of our lives – our thoughts, our words, our actions, 
                and our decisions. It means trusting that He knows what is best for us and that He will lead us to holiness.

                As we complete this novena, we should reflect on how the Sacred Heart has been working in our lives 
                during these nine days. Have we grown in love and devotion? Have we become more aware of His presence 
                and guidance? Have we experienced His love and mercy in new ways?

                The end of this novena is not the end of our relationship with the Sacred Heart. It is the beginning 
                of a deeper, more intimate relationship with Jesus. Let us commit ourselves to continue seeking His 
                guidance and to live under His influence every day of our lives.
