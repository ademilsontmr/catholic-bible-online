                <strong>Our Lady of Sorrows,</strong> you experienced profound emotional anguish as you watched your Son mistreated, scourged, and condemned to death. Your maternal heart was torn by every blow, yet you remained faithful to God's plan.

                Today we pray for all who suffer from emotional pain, anxiety, and heartbreak to find comfort and peace 
                through Mary's maternal care.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Our Lady of Sorrows experienced profound emotional anguish as she watched her Son mistreated, scourged, 
                and condemned to death. Her maternal heart was torn by every blow, yet she remained faithful to God's plan. 
                She knows what it means to suffer emotional pain.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's example teaches us that even in the midst of emotional suffering, we can remain faithful to God. 
                She shows us that emotional pain can be offered to God and united with the sufferings of Jesus. 
                She comforts us as she comforted her Son.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask Mary to pray for all who suffer from emotional pain, anxiety, and heartbreak. 
                May they find comfort and peace through her maternal care. Let us ask her to bring them peace and hope 
                amid their trials.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let us also ask Mary to pray for us, that we may unite our sufferings to those of Jesus and find strength 
                in His Cross. May we grow in intimacy with Him through every difficulty. Mary's example shows us that 
                emotional suffering can be a path to deeper union with Christ.
