              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for selfless love as we continue our Christmas Novena. The incarnation of Jesus Christ is the greatest example 
                of selfless love - God becoming man to save us from our sins.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus humbled Himself to become like us in all things but sin. He who was God chose to become a helpless infant, 
                to live as a simple carpenter, and even to die the most humiliating death on the cross. This is the ultimate expression 
                of selfless love - giving everything for the sake of others.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us love as Jesus loves. Let us ask Him to inspire in us the same selfless love 
                that He showed us through His incarnation, life, and death. Let us pray that we may learn to love others 
                with the same kind of sacrificial love.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that true love is not just a feeling, but a choice and an action. It is choosing to put the needs of others 
                before our own, just as Jesus did for us. This is the kind of love that we are called to practice in our daily lives.
