                Today we pray for the gift of Faith as we continue our Christmas Novena. Faith is the foundation of our relationship with God, 
                and it is through faith that we come to believe in the mystery of the Incarnation - that God became man in the person of Jesus Christ.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Lord Jesus Christ deserves our complete faith. He who is the Word of God, whose glory is complete, 
                chose to come to us in perfect humility as a child in the womb. This act of love and humility is unsurpassed 
                and should bring us to our knees in prayer and worship.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to give us deeper and more perfect faith in Jesus Christ. 
                Let us ask Him to help us believe with all our hearts in the mystery of the Incarnation, 
                and to trust in Jesus as our Lord and Savior.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that faith is a gift from God, and we can ask Him to increase it in us. 
                As we continue this novena, let us open our hearts to receive this gift and to grow in our faith in Jesus Christ.
