                Today we pray for Divine Mercy as we continue our Christmas Novena. The mercy of God is unending and infinite, 
                and through the incarnation of Jesus Christ, we have been given the greatest gift of mercy - the forgiveness of our sins.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus Christ came into the world to show us the mercy of God. He came not to condemn the world, but to save it. 
                Through His life, death, and resurrection, He has made it possible for us to receive God's mercy and forgiveness.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us participate in His mercy by forgiving others. 
                Just as God has forgiven us through Jesus Christ, we are called to forgive those who have hurt us. 
                This is not always easy, but it is what we are called to do as followers of Christ.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that mercy is at the heart of the Gospel. Jesus taught us to pray, "Forgive us our trespasses, 
                as we forgive those who trespass against us." Let us ask God to help us live this prayer in our daily lives.
