                Today we pray for peace as we continue our Christmas Novena. Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace, 
                and through His incarnation, He came to bring peace to the world.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The peace that Jesus brings is not just the absence of conflict, but a deep, inner peace that comes from being reconciled with God. 
                This peace is a gift that surpasses all understanding and can sustain us even in the most difficult circumstances.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The ultimate fulfillment of Jesus' incarnation will bring us to heaven, where peace will come to perfection. 
                In heaven, there will be no more tears, no more pain, no more conflict - only perfect peace in the presence of God.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As we pray today, let us ask God to give us His peace. Let us ask Him to help us experience the peace 
                that comes from knowing and loving Jesus Christ, and to look forward with hope to the perfect peace of heaven.
