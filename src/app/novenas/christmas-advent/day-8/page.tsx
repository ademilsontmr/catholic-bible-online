                Today we pray for holiness as we continue our Christmas Novena. Jesus Christ is holy, but we are not. 
                We are sinners in need of God's grace to become holy.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The incarnation of Jesus Christ shows us what true holiness looks like. Jesus, who is God, became man 
                to show us the way to holiness and to make it possible for us to become holy through His grace.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us be repulsed by sin and to desire holiness instead. 
                Let us ask Him to make us holy and to keep us from temptation. This is not something we can do on our own, 
                but only with God's grace and help.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that holiness is not about being perfect, but about striving to be more like Jesus Christ. 
                It is about turning away from sin and turning toward God. Let us ask God to help us in this journey toward holiness.
