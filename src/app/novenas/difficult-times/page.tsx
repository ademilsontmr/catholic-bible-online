              The Novena for Difficult Times is a traditional nine-day prayer that helps us find strength, hope, and divine assistance 
              during challenging periods in our lives. This novena draws on the powerful intercession of various saints who understand 
              different types of suffering and can help us navigate through our own difficulties.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Each day focuses on a different aspect of difficulty - from financial struggles to health problems, from employment 
              challenges to mental health issues. Through the intercession of saints who have experienced similar trials, we seek 
              God's guidance and strength to overcome our own challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This novena reminds us that we are not alone in our suffering and that God, through His saints, provides us with 
              the support and intercession we need to persevere through difficult times.
