              A difficult pregnancy can involve various challenges that make the pregnancy journey more 
              challenging than usual. These challenges can include physical pain and discomfort, mental 
              health issues such as anxiety and depression, emotional stress, financial difficulties, 
              lack of support from family or partners, advanced maternal age complications, and other 
              pregnancy-related health concerns.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic understanding of difficult pregnancies recognizes that while pregnancy is a 
              beautiful gift from God, it can also bring significant challenges that require divine 
              assistance, medical support, and community care. God wants to provide strength, comfort, 
              and hope to all women experiencing pregnancy difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novena helps you to bring all your pregnancy challenges to God, who understands your 
              struggles intimately and wants to provide you with the strength, support, and peace you need 
              to carry your child safely and to grow in holiness throughout your pregnancy journey.
