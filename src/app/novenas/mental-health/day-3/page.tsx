                Today we pray for wisdom and understanding in managing mental health.
                Wisdom and Understanding are gifts from God that help us face life's challenges.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The Bible tells us that "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13).
                This powerful verse reminds us that our strength comes from God, not from ourselves.
                When we feel weak or overwhelmed, we can turn to Him for the help we need.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our creator and our healer. He knows every aspect of our mental health and every challenge we face.
                As our loving Father, He wants what is best for us and is always ready to help us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to give us the wisdom and understanding we need
                to manage our mental health well and to face each day with hope and confidence.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's help is available to us every day, and His love
                can help us overcome any obstacle we face in our mental health journey.
