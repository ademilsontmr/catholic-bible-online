                <strong>Opening Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for the many ways You have blessed us through the work of doctors in our world. We ask You to pour out Your grace and assistance on all doctors.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Prayer for Submission to God's Will:</strong><br/>
                Doctors often encounter death and dying people over the course of their professional lives. Though doctors put forth great effort to save the lives of their patients, they are not always successful. We might have difficulty understanding Your will when we encounter death. Doctors are in great need of submission to Your will.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Daily Intention:</strong><br/>
                Please give doctors all the help they need in their work, and we particularly ask today that You help all doctors to grow in submission to Your will.

                <strong>Closing Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Help us to truly surrender to You in all aspects of our lives. Give us the grace to trust You even in the midst of difficulties. And we especially ask in this novena (mention your intentions here). Lord, hear our prayers!

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for doctors to grow in submission to God's will when facing death and loss. Luke 22:42 shows us Jesus' perfect submission to the Father's will, even in the face of suffering and death. Doctors, who often encounter death in their work, need to cultivate this same spirit of submission. Despite their best efforts and medical advances, doctors cannot save every life. This reality can be difficult to accept, especially for doctors who have dedicated their lives to healing. They may struggle with feelings of failure or question why God allows suffering and death. Doctors need God's grace to accept that they are instruments of His healing, not the ultimate healers. They need to trust that God has a plan for each person's life and death. They need to find peace in knowing that they have done their best and that the outcome is in God's hands. This submission to God's will can bring them peace and help them to continue their healing ministry with hope and trust.</p>
