                The work that doctors do can be very important for our world. Doctors can help many people and have a deep positive impact on them.

                Today we pray for doctors to offer all their work to God's glory and grow in holiness.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Doctors have a unique opportunity to live out this teaching in their medical practice. 
                Every diagnosis, every treatment, every surgery can be offered to God as an act of worship and service.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                When doctors approach their work with this mindset, their medical practice becomes a true ministry. 
                They can find meaning and purpose in even the most routine tasks when they offer them to God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                This offering of their work to God can help doctors to grow in holiness, as they see their medical practice 
                as a way to serve and glorify God. It can give them strength during difficult times and help them to maintain their focus on their calling.

              <p>
                As we complete this novena, let us pray that all doctors will grow in holiness and that their medical practice 
                will be a true offering to God. May they find sanctification in their work and see it as a ministry of healing.
