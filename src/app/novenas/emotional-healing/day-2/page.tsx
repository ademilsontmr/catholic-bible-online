              <p className="mb-4">Dear Heavenly Father, we come before You today with hearts that are heavy with emotional pain and wounds that seem too deep to heal. We acknowledge that You are the Divine Physician, the One who created our hearts and knows every emotion, every hurt, and every tear that we have shed. You understand the depths of our suffering because You have experienced it Yourself through Your Son, Jesus Christ, who bore our sorrows and carried our griefs.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that emotional healing is not something we can achieve on our own. We need Your divine intervention, Your healing touch, and Your infinite love to restore our broken hearts. We come to You today placing our complete trust in Your power to heal all wounds, no matter how deep or how old they may be. We believe that nothing is impossible for You, and that You can bring beauty from ashes and joy from mourning.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Help us to trust in Your perfect timing and Your perfect plan for our healing. We know that You work all things for the good of those who love You, and we trust that even our emotional pain can be transformed into something beautiful through Your grace. Give us the faith to believe that You are working in our hearts even when we cannot see or feel the healing taking place.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We ask You to increase our trust in Your promises, especially Your promise to be with us always and to never leave us or forsake us. Help us to believe that You are present in our suffering and that You are actively working to bring about our emotional restoration. May our trust in You be a light that shines brightly, inspiring others to also trust in Your healing power.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to surrender all our emotional burdens to You, knowing that You care for us deeply and want to carry our heavy loads. Teach us to cast all our anxieties on You because You care for us. Help us to remember that Your yoke is easy and Your burden is light, and that You want to give us rest for our weary souls.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are suffering from emotional wounds and trauma. May they too come to trust in Your healing power and find comfort in Your loving embrace. Help us to be instruments of Your healing love to others, sharing the hope and peace that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific emotional healing intentions here). We trust that You will answer our prayers according to Your perfect will and in Your perfect timing. Thank You for Your love, Your mercy, and Your healing power. We place our complete trust in You, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
