              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for college students who are preparing to take exams as part of their higher education. College exams often carry significant weight for a student's academic future, including their GPA, graduation requirements, and potential career opportunities. James 1:5 reminds us that if we lack wisdom, we should ask God, who gives generously to all. This promise offers hope to college students that God will provide them with the wisdom and knowledge they need for their exams. College students face unique challenges - they may be living away from home for the first time, managing multiple classes and assignments, and dealing with the pressure of maintaining good grades for scholarships or graduate school applications. Let us pray that college students preparing for exams will find strength in God's promise to provide wisdom and that they will trust in His guidance for their academic journey.</p>
