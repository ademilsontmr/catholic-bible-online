                <strong>Opening Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Lord God, we thank You for the gift of education and for the ability to learn. We ask You to bless all people who must take exams for their education or professional life.

                <strong>Prayer for Submission to God's Will:</strong><br/>
                As we prepare for exams, we are often anxious because we do not know how well we will do on our exams. Sometimes, the outcome of our exams can be very important for our lives. But we must strive to submit ourselves to God's will for us and to trust that He will provide for all that we need in our lives.

                <strong>Daily Intention:</strong><br/>
                Today we pray for all preparing for exams to grow in submission to God's will. We ask God to help all preparing for exams to grow in submission to His will.

                We ask You to assist all who must take exams, and we particularly ask You today to help all preparing for exams to grow in submission to Your will! Help us to make growth in virtue and holiness our highest priority in life. Help us to love and trust in You more and more each day.

                Today we pray for all preparing for exams to grow in submission to God's will. When we face important exams, it can be easy to become overly focused on the outcome and to worry about how our performance will affect our future.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Matthew 6:33 reminds us to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all other things will be added to us. This teaching calls us to prioritize our relationship with God above all else, including academic success.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Submitting to God's will doesn't mean we shouldn't study hard or try our best. Rather, it means we should trust that God has a plan for our lives and that He will provide for our needs regardless of the outcome of our exams. It means finding peace in knowing that our worth is not determined by our test scores, but by our identity as children of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let us pray that those preparing for exams will find the grace to submit to God's will while still working diligently, and that they will trust in His love and providence.
