              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for those who are suffering from anxiety about an upcoming exam. Exam anxiety is a very real and common experience that can affect students of all ages and levels. Philippians 4:6-7 reminds us not to be anxious about anything, but to present our requests to God with thanksgiving, and He will give us peace that surpasses understanding. This promise offers hope to those suffering from exam anxiety that God can provide them with peace and calm. Exam anxiety can manifest in many ways - difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, racing thoughts, physical symptoms like nausea or headaches, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can actually interfere with a person's ability to study effectively and perform well on exams. Let us pray that those suffering from exam anxiety will find peace in God's promise and that they will be able to approach their exams with calm and confidence.</p>
