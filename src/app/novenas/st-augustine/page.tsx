            <p className="mb-4">
              St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) is one of the most influential saints and doctors of the Church. 
              Born in North Africa, he lived a worldly life in his youth before experiencing a profound conversion 
              through the prayers of his mother, St. Monica. His famous quote "Our hearts were made for you, O Lord, 
              and they are restless until they rest in you" captures the essence of his spiritual journey.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              After his conversion, St. Augustine became a bishop, theologian, and prolific writer whose works 
              continue to influence Christian thought today. He is known for his powerful intercession, miracles, 
              and ability to help others find their purpose in God. His life demonstrates that no one is beyond 
              God's mercy and grace.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novena helps you to seek St. Augustine's intercession for wisdom, conversion, and finding 
              true rest in God's love, just as he found after his own conversion experience.
