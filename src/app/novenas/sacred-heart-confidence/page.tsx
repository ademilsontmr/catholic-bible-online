              <strong>The Sacred Heart of Jesus</strong> is the physical heart of Jesus Christ, which represents His infinite love 
              for humanity. This devotion honors His Heart as the symbol of His divine love, mercy, and compassion 
              for all people.

              <strong>Symbol of Love</strong> - The Sacred Heart is the perfect symbol of God's love for us. It represents 
              the burning love that Jesus has for each person, a love that led Him to suffer and die on the Cross 
              for our salvation.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Source of Mercy</strong> - The Sacred Heart is the source of all mercy and grace. From this Heart 
              flows the blood and water that cleanse us from sin and give us new life. It is the fountain of 
              all spiritual blessings.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Open and Broken</strong> - The Sacred Heart is often depicted as open and wounded, pierced by the lance 
              on the Cross. This represents His willingness to receive all our prayers and intentions, and His 
              suffering love for us.

              second Sunday after Pentecost, and this novena is especially popular among those seeking to grow 
              in confidence, trust in God's mercy, and experience the love of the Sacred Heart.
