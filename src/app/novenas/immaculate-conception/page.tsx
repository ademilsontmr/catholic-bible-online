            <p className="mb-4">
              The Immaculate Conception is the Catholic dogma that the Blessed Virgin Mary was conceived without original 
              sin from the very first instant of her existence. This means that Mary, from the moment of her conception 
              in her mother\'s womb, was preserved from the stain of original sin by a special grace from God.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              This singular privilege was given to Mary because she was chosen by God to be the mother of Jesus Christ, 
              our Savior. The Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords chose her for the singular grace and honor of being His 
              beloved mother, and by the power of His Cross, He preserved her from all sin.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Queen of Angels and of men, Mary serves as our model of perfect holiness and submission to God\'s will. 
              Through this novena, we honor her Immaculate Conception and seek her powerful intercession to help us grow 
              in faith, hope, and love, and to imitate her perfect obedience to the Divine Will.
