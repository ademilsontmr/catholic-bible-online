              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, your share of suffering was very great because of your close union with the Divine Savior.</strong> All the mysteries of His life were more or less mysteries of suffering. Poverty pressed upon you, and the cross of labor followed you everywhere. Nor were you spared domestic crosses, owing to misunderstandings in regard to the holiest and most cherished of all beings, Jesus and Mary, who were all to you.
              </p>
              

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, I thank God for your privilege of having been chosen by God to be the foster-father of His Divine Son.</strong> As a token of your own gratitude to God for this your greatest privilege, obtain for me the grace of a very devoted love for Jesus Christ, my God and my Savior. Help me to serve Him with some of the self-sacrificing love and devotion which you had while on this earth with Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, I, your unworthy child, greet you.</strong> You are the faithful protector and intercessor of all who love and venerate you. You know that I have special confidence in you and that, after Jesus and Mary, I place all my hope of salvation in you, for you are especially powerful with God and will never abandon your faithful servants.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Glorious Saint Joseph, spouse of the Immaculate Virgin,</strong> obtain for me a pure, humble, charitable mind, and perfect resignation to the divine Will. Be my guide, my father, and my model through life that I may merit to die as you did in the arms of Jesus and Mary.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Loving Saint Joseph, faithful follower of Jesus Christ,</strong> I raise my heart to you to implore your powerful intercession in obtaining from the Divine Heart of Jesus all the graces necessary for my spiritual and temporal welfare, particularly the grace of a happy death, and the special grace I now implore:
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>(Mention your request).</strong>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Guardian of the Word Incarnate, I feel confident that your prayers in my behalf will be graciously heard before the throne of God. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>MEMORARE</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Remember, most pure spouse of Mary, ever Virgin, my loving protector, Saint Joseph,</strong> that no one ever had recourse to your protection or asked for your aid without obtaining relief. Confiding, therefore, in your goodness, I come before you and humbly implore you. Despise not my petitions, foster-father of the Redeemer, but graciously receive them. Amen.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</strong>
