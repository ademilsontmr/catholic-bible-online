              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, God has appointed you patron of the Catholic Church because you were the head of the Holy Family, the starting-point of the Church.</strong> You were the father, protector, guide and support of the Holy Family. For that reason you belong in a particular way to the Church, which was the purpose of the Holy Family's existence. You have a special relationship to the priesthood because you possessed a wonderful power over our Savior Himself.
              </p>
              

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, I thank God for your privilege of having been chosen by God to be the foster-father of His Divine Son.</strong> As a token of your own gratitude to God for this your greatest privilege, obtain for me the grace of a very devoted love for Jesus Christ, my God and my Savior. Help me to serve Him with some of the self-sacrificing love and devotion which you had while on this earth with Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Saint Joseph, I, your unworthy child, greet you.</strong> You are the faithful protector and intercessor of all who love and venerate you. You know that I have special confidence in you and that, after Jesus and Mary, I place all my hope of salvation in you, for you are especially powerful with God and will never abandon your faithful servants.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Glorious Saint Joseph, spouse of the Immaculate Virgin,</strong> obtain for me a pure, humble, charitable mind, and perfect resignation to the divine Will. Be my guide, my father, and my model through life that I may merit to die as you did in the arms of Jesus and Mary.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Loving Saint Joseph, faithful follower of Jesus Christ,</strong> I raise my heart to you to implore your powerful intercession in obtaining from the Divine Heart of Jesus all the graces necessary for my spiritual and temporal welfare, particularly the grace of a happy death, and the special grace I now implore:
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Remember, most pure spouse of Mary, ever Virgin, my loving protector, Saint Joseph,</strong> that no one ever had recourse to your protection or asked for your aid without obtaining relief. Confiding, therefore, in your goodness, I come before you and humbly implore you. Despise not my petitions, foster-father of the Redeemer, but graciously receive them. Amen.
              </p>
