                It can be difficult to submit ourselves fully to God and to the rules His Church calls us to follow. At times, we can feel tempted to follow our own will. But You can help us to submit ourselves to You and Your Church as Your humble servants.

                Today we pray for submission to God. Submission means accepting God's will and the teachings of His Church. It requires trust that God knows what is best for us and that His ways lead to true happiness and holiness.

                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to help us grow in submission to god. 
                Let us ask Him to give us the grace we need to prepare well for our First Confession 
                and to approach this sacrament with the right disposition of heart.

                Submission to God is essential for a good confession. We must be willing to admit our faults 
                honestly and without excuses. This virtue allows us to receive God's grace and forgiveness 
                with open hearts.

              <p>
                Remember that God is always ready to help us grow in virtue. He wants us to receive His 
                forgiveness and mercy, and He will guide us through the preparation process if we ask for His help.
