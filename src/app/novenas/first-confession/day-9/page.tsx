                Today we pray for love for God. Love is the foundation of our relationship with God. 
                When we truly love God, we want to avoid sin and stay close to Him. The sacrament of 
                confession helps us grow in this love by restoring our relationship with Him.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                God loved us first, as St. John tells us. His love is unconditional and never-ending. 
                The sacrament of confession is one of the ways He shows His love for us, offering us 
                forgiveness and reconciliation whenever we turn to Him.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we complete this novena, let us thank God for His love and for the gift of the sacrament 
                of confession. Let us ask Him to help us grow in love for Him and to make this love the 
                foundation of our spiritual lives.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Love for God motivates us to avoid sin and to seek holiness. When we truly love someone, 
                we want to please them and avoid hurting them. The same is true in our relationship with God.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that God's love for us is the source of all our love for Him. We love because 
                He first loved us. Let us ask Him to increase our love for Him and to help us express 
                this love through our actions and our faithfulness to His commandments.
