                Today we pray for the perseverance needed for success in business. Perseverance is the virtue that helps us 
                to continue working toward our goals even when faced with difficulties and setbacks.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Business endeavors often require great effort and can be challenging. We may face financial difficulties, 
                competition, market changes, or other obstacles that can make us want to give up. In these moments, 
                we need the grace of perseverance to continue moving forward.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Perseverance is not about never experiencing difficulties, but about continuing to work toward our goals 
                even when things are difficult. It's about trusting that God will help us overcome obstacles and achieve 
                success in His time and according to His will.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we work on our business endeavors, let us remember that God is with us in our struggles. He wants to help 
                us persevere and achieve success, but He also wants us to grow in virtue and holiness through our efforts.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let us ask God today to give us the grace of perseverance. Let us ask Him to help us continue working 
                toward our business goals with faith and trust, knowing that He will provide for our needs and help us succeed.
