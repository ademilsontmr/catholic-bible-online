              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for the courage needed for success in business. Courage is the virtue that helps us to face challenges and take risks, even when we are afraid of failure or uncertainty.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Starting or growing a business requires courage. We may need to invest significant time and money, take on new responsibilities, or face the possibility of failure. These challenges can be frightening and may cause us to hesitate or give up before we even begin.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">However, courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act despite our fears. It's about trusting that God will provide for our needs and help us succeed, even when the path ahead is uncertain. It's about believing that God has given us the talents and opportunities we need to succeed.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we work on our business endeavors, let us ask God to give us the courage we need to take the necessary steps toward success. Let us ask Him to help us overcome our fears and to trust in His guidance and provision. With His help, we can face any challenge with confidence and hope.</p>
