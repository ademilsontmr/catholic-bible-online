              <p className="mb-6">Seeking success in our business endeavors is a holy and worthwhile goal for us to pursue. But even more important than worldly success in business is spiritual success. You can help us to grow in holiness as we work to pursue worldly success in our business endeavors.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Holiness is not just about avoiding sin, but about growing closer to God and becoming more like Him in our thoughts, words, and actions. In the context of business, holiness means conducting our business in a way that reflects God's love, justice, and mercy. It means treating our employees, customers, and competitors with respect and fairness.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Growing in holiness in business also means using our business success to serve God and others. It means recognizing that our talents and resources are gifts from God and should be used to glorify Him and help others. It means being generous with our time, money, and resources.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we work toward business success, let us remember that our ultimate goal is not just financial gain, but growing closer to God and becoming the people He created us to be. Let us ask Him today to help us grow in holiness through our business endeavors and to use our success to serve Him and others.</p>
