              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray to grow in submission to God's will as we work for success in business. This day teaches us that true success comes not from forcing our own plans, but from aligning our business goals with God's will for our lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">In business, we often have our own ideas about what success looks like and how to achieve it. We may have specific goals, timelines, and strategies that we believe will lead to success. However, God's plan for our business may be different from our own, and we need to learn to trust in His wisdom and timing.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Submission to God's will doesn't mean being passive or not working hard. Instead, it means working diligently while remaining open to God's guidance and accepting that His plan may be different from our own. It means trusting that God knows what is best for us and will provide for our needs according to His plan.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we work on our business endeavors, let us ask God to help us grow in submission to His will. Let us ask Him to guide our decisions and to help us accept both the successes and challenges that come our way, knowing that everything works for our good when we trust in Him.</p>
