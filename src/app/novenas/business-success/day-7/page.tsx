              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for success to all businesses that lead souls to God. This day reminds us that business can be a powerful tool for evangelization and spreading God's love to others.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Every business has the potential to lead souls to God, not just those that are explicitly religious. When we conduct our business with integrity, fairness, and love, we reflect God's character and can inspire others to seek Him. When we use our business success to help others and serve the common good, we demonstrate God's love in action.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Leading souls to God through business doesn't necessarily mean preaching or evangelizing directly. Instead, it means being a witness to God's love through our actions and attitudes. It means treating everyone we encounter with respect and dignity, recognizing that they are made in God's image.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we work on our business endeavors, let us ask God to help us use our business as a tool for leading others to Him. Let us ask Him to help us be witnesses to His love and to use our success to serve others and glorify Him.</p>
