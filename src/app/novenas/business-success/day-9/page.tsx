              <p className="mb-4">Dedicating our work to God means recognizing that our talents, opportunities, and success are all gifts from Him. It means working not just for our own benefit, but for the glory of God and the good of others. It means offering our daily work as a prayer and seeing our business as a way to serve God and His people.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">When we orient our work to God, we find deeper meaning and purpose in what we do. We recognize that our business is not just about making money, but about using our God-given talents to serve others and glorify Him. This perspective helps us to work with greater joy, dedication, and perseverance.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we conclude this novena, let us ask God to help us orient all of our work to Him. Let us ask Him to help us see our business as a way to serve Him and others, and to find true success in doing His will. May our business endeavors always be a means of growing closer to God and becoming the people He created us to be.</p>
