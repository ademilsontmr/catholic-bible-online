            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for growing in deeper intimacy with God through the Holy Eucharist. The Eucharist is the most intimate way we can be united with Jesus on this earth. In John 15:4, Jesus speaks of abiding in Him, and this is exactly what happens when we receive the Eucharist - we abide in Him and He abides in us. This intimate union is not just a spiritual reality, but a physical one as well, for we literally receive Jesus' Body and Blood into our own bodies. This intimacy transforms us from within, making us more like Christ. The more we receive the Eucharist worthily, the deeper our intimacy with God becomes. Let us pray that all who are preparing for their First Communion will come to understand and experience this deep intimacy with Jesus through the Eucharist.</p>
