                We can never truly deserve the great gift of the Eucharist that You have given to us. But You ask us to remove all stain of mortal sin from our souls through the sacrament of Confession before we receive Your Body and Blood in the Eucharist.

                Please assist all who are preparing to make their First Holy Communion, and we particularly ask today that You help us and all who are preparing for their First Holy Communion to always receive the Eucharist worthily!

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for always receiving the Eucharist worthily. St. Paul's warning in 1 Corinthians 11:27 is serious - we must not receive the Eucharist in an unworthy manner. To receive worthily means to be in a state of grace, free from mortal sin. This is why the sacrament of Confession is so important - it restores us to a state of grace so that we can receive the Eucharist worthily. For those preparing for their First Communion, this means making a good confession before receiving the Eucharist for the first time. But this is not just a one-time requirement - we must always examine our conscience and go to confession when needed before receiving the Eucharist. Let us pray that all who are preparing for their First Communion will understand the importance of worthy reception and will always approach the Eucharist with a clean heart.</p>
