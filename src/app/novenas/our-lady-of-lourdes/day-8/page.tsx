            her ability to bring our prayers to Jesus and to work miracles on our behalf. We ask Mary to 
            intercede for us and to bring our needs and intentions to her Son.

                <strong>O Most Powerful Intercessor, Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our Mother,</strong> 
                you appeared at Lourdes and have worked countless miracles for those who turn to you. 
                You are the most powerful intercessor before God, and your prayers are always heard.

                <strong>On this eighth day of our novena, we pray for your powerful intercession.</strong> 
                Please bring our prayers and intentions to your Son, Jesus Christ. Intercede for us 
                and ask Him to grant us the graces we need for our spiritual and temporal well-being.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O Mary, you are the Mediatrix of all graces,</strong> for God has given you 
                the power to intercede for us and to bring our prayers to Him. You are the most powerful 
                advocate we have in heaven, and your intercession can work miracles in our lives.

                Today we focus on Mary's powerful intercession, one of the most beautiful aspects of our 
                relationship with her. Mary is not only our Mother, but she is also our most powerful 
                advocate and intercessor before God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                At Lourdes, Mary has worked countless miracles through her intercession. Countless people 
                have been healed physically and spiritually, and many have experienced profound conversions 
                through her powerful prayers. This shows us the great power of Mary's intercession.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's intercession is powerful because she is the Mother of God and because she is 
                sinless. Her prayers are pure and perfect, and God listens to them with special favor. 
                She is the Mediatrix of all graces, meaning that God has given her a special role in 
                distributing His graces to us.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The miraculous spring at Lourdes is a symbol of the graces that flow through Mary's 
                intercession. Just as the spring brings physical healing to many, Mary's intercession 
                brings spiritual healing and grace to all who turn to her with trust and confidence.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As we pray today, let us ask Mary to intercede for us and to bring our prayers to Jesus. 
                Let us trust in her powerful intercession and believe that she will help us in all our needs. 
                Let us thank her for being our most powerful advocate and for always being ready to help us.
