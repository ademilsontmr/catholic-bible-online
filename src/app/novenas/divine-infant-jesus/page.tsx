              <strong>Childlike Trust</strong> - The Divine Infant Jesus teaches us to trust in God with the simplicity 
              and confidence of a child. Just as a child trusts completely in their parents, we are called to trust 
              completely in God's love and care for us.

              <strong>Consolation and Peace</strong> - The Divine Infant Jesus is a source of consolation for all Christians. 
              He brings peace to the troubled heart and relief from burdens. His love is unconditional and His help 
              is always available to those who trust in Him.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Never Disappointed</strong> - The tradition of this devotion assures us that no one who has implored 
              the Divine Infant Jesus has ever been disappointed. He is faithful to His promise to help all who turn to Him 
              with trust and confidence.
