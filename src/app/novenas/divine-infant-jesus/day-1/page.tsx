              The Divine Infant Jesus teaches us to trust in God with the simplicity and confidence of a child. Just as a child trusts completely in their parents, we are called to trust completely in God's love and care for us.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              As we reflect on this aspect of our relationship with the Divine Infant Jesus, let us ask ourselves how we can 
              better trust in Him with childlike confidence and place all our needs in His blessed hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              May the Divine Infant Jesus continue to bless us with His love and grace, and may we always remember 
              that no one who implores Him is ever disappointed.
