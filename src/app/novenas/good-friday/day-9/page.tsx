                Today we focus on suffering as we commemorate Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Good Friday reminds us of the depth of Christ's love for us and His willingness to suffer and die for our salvation.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The Bible tells us that "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). Christ showed us the greatest love by dying on the cross for our sins.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray this novena, we are called to unite our sufferings with Christ's Passion and to grow in gratitude for His redemptive love. Each day helps us to understand a different aspect of His sacrifice and our response to it.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Through this novena, we ask God to help us grow in piety, charity, and the ability to offer our sufferings in union with Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that Christ's death on the cross opened the gates of heaven for us, and through our prayers and penance, we can help others to come to know and love Him.
