            On this ninth day of the Novena for Courage, we pray for gratitude in God's plan and His ability

                Today we pray for gratitude in God's plan and His ability to grant us courage in all situations.
                Gratitude is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to finding strength in challenging circumstances.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to help us.
                As our Father, He knows exactly what we need and when we need it, especially when it comes to courage.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The focus on trusting in God's rewards reminds us that courage is not just about physical bravery, but about 
                moral and spiritual strength. God calls us to be courageous in many different ways throughout our lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our gratitude in Him.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always help us and provide us with the courage we need.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's courage is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to help us, and we can trust completely in His divine care.
