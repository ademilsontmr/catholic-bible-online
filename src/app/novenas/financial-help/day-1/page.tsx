                Today we pray for trust in God's provision and His ability to care for all our needs.
                Trust is the foundation of our relationship with God and our approach to financial matters.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus tells us in Matthew 6:25-34 not to worry about what we will eat or drink or wear,
                for our heavenly Father knows that we need these things. He assures us that if we seek
                His kingdom first, all these things will be added unto us.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Financial Help" reminds us that God is our ultimate provider and helper
                in all financial matters. He is always ready to guide us, provide for us, and help us
                make wise financial decisions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we begin this novena, let us ask God to increase our trust in Him.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every financial need,
                knowing that He will always provide for us according to His perfect plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's provision is not limited by our circumstances or the world's economy.
                He is the creator of all things and can provide for us in ways we cannot imagine.
