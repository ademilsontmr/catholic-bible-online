                <strong>Heavenly Father,</strong> you are the source of all humility and the giver of every good gift.
                You have promised that those who humble themselves will be exalted.

                Today we pray for humility in recognizing our need for God's help and guidance.
                Humility is the foundation of our relationship with God and our approach to all challenges.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                St. James tells us in James 4:6 that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
                This reminds us that humility is essential for receiving God's grace and help in our lives.
                Our humility opens us to receive God's assistance in all our financial matters.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Financial Help" reminds us that God is our ultimate helper and provider
                in all financial matters. He is always ready to guide us, provide for us, and help us
                make wise financial decisions when we approach Him with humility.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our humility.
                Let us ask Him to help us recognize our need for His help and guidance
                in every financial situation we face.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that humility is not weakness, but strength in recognizing our dependence on God.
                It is the key to receiving God's grace and assistance in all areas of our lives.
