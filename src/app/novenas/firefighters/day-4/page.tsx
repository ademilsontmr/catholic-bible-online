Sometimes, firefighters even face grave danger to themselves as they work to save people from fires and to put fires out. You can protect all firefighters who are in harm's way.

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for the protection of firefighters who face grave danger in their work. Firefighters regularly put themselves in harm's way to save others. They enter burning buildings, face collapsing structures, and work in extremely dangerous conditions. Psalm 91:11-12 speaks of God's protection through His angels. This promise is especially important for firefighters who need divine protection as they work in dangerous situations. They need to know that God is watching over them and that His angels are guarding them in all their ways. Let us pray that firefighters will be protected by God's angels and that they will be kept safe from the many dangers they face in their work.</p>
