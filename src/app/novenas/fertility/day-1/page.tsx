                <strong>Prayer for Women with Infertility:</strong><br/>
                Our fertility is a great blessing from You, and the discovery of infertility can be a very difficult burden to bear. 
                Women who have been diagnosed as infertile often suffer great pain and anguish over their inability to conceive a child.

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for women who have been diagnosed as infertile. The pain of infertility can be overwhelming for women 
                who long to become mothers. This pain is often compounded by feelings of inadequacy, grief, and isolation.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Psalm 139:13-14 reminds us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made by God. This truth applies to every woman, 
                regardless of her fertility status. God's love for us is not dependent on our ability to conceive children. 
                Each woman is precious in His sight and has inherent dignity and worth.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Women struggling with infertility often feel that their bodies have betrayed them or that they are somehow 
                less of a woman because they cannot conceive. These feelings can be devastating and can affect every aspect 
                of their lives - their marriage, their self-esteem, and their relationship with God.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we begin this novena, let us remember that God sees the pain of these women and loves them deeply. 
                He understands their suffering and wants to comfort them. Our prayers can help these women find peace, 
                hope, and a renewed sense of their worth in God's eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let us pray that women with infertility will find comfort in God's love and that they will come to understand 
                that their worth is not defined by their fertility, but by their identity as beloved daughters of God.
