                Lord God, we thank You and praise You for allowing us to share in Your creative power through the gift of procreation. 
                Please help all married couples who are struggling with the inability to conceive and bear children!

                <strong>Prayer for Offering Suffering:</strong><br/>
                The inability to conceive a child can be a source of great sorrow and suffering. It is not always easy to offer up our sufferings in union with Yours, but You are able to give us the grace necessary to use our sufferings for good.

                <strong>Closing Prayer:</strong><br/>
                We ask You to bless and assist all who are struggling with infertility, and we particularly ask You today to help us to offer all of our sufferings in union with You! Help us to never become discouraged in the midst of suffering. Help us to grow closer to You through even the most difficult trials. And I especially ask in this novena (mention your intentions here). Lord, hear our prayers!

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for couples to offer their sufferings in union with Christ and use them for good. The suffering of infertility can feel overwhelming and meaningless, but when offered to God, it can become a powerful means of grace and redemption.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Colossians 1:24 shows us that our sufferings can be united with Christ\'s sufferings for the good of the Church. Couples struggling with infertility can offer their pain for the conversion of sinners, for other couples facing similar struggles, for the souls in purgatory, or for any other intention.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                This offering transforms their suffering from something that seems meaningless into something that has great spiritual value. It also helps couples grow closer to Christ, who understands suffering and who can give meaning to our pain.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us pray that couples facing infertility will find the grace to offer their sufferings to God and that they will find meaning and purpose even in their pain.
