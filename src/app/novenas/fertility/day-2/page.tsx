                <strong>Prayer for Men with Infertility:</strong><br/>
                Many married couples are eager to raise children and to begin the holy duties of parenthood. But some couples are not able to conceive a child, and some even receive a medical diagnosis of infertility. A diagnosis of infertility can make parenthood seem impossible.

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for men who have been diagnosed infertile. While infertility is often discussed in terms of women\'s experiences, men also suffer deeply when they receive a diagnosis of infertility. Men may feel that they have failed in their role as husbands and potential fathers, and they may struggle with feelings of inadequacy and shame. Genesis 1:28 reminds us of God\'s original blessing to be fruitful and multiply. When men face infertility, they may feel that they are somehow falling short of this divine command. However, it\'s important to remember that God\'s love for us is not conditional on our fertility. Each man is valuable and loved by God regardless of his ability to father biological children. Let us pray that men with infertility will find strength in God and that they will come to understand that their worth is not defined by their fertility, but by their identity as beloved sons of God.</p>
