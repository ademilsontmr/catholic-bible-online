                <strong>Opening Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Lord God, we thank You and praise You for allowing us to share in Your creative power through the gift of procreation. Please help all married couples who are struggling with the inability to conceive and bear children!

                <strong>Prayer for Respect for Life:</strong><br/>
                Many couples who struggle with infertility feel desperate to be able to conceive a child. Those who work in fertility medicine do not always keep the sanctity of life or sexual morality in mind as they work to help couples be able to conceive.

                We ask You to bless and assist all who are struggling with infertility, and we particularly ask You today to help respect for life and for sexual morality increase within fertility medicine! Help us to always be submissive to Your laws in our life. Help us to grow in virtue even when it is very difficult. And I especially ask in this novena (mention your intentions here).

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for increased respect for life and sexual morality within fertility medicine. The field of reproductive medicine has made great advances in helping couples conceive, but it has also raised serious ethical concerns about the treatment of human embryos and the separation of procreation from the marital act. Psalm 139:16 reminds us that God sees and knows each human life from the very beginning, even before we are formed in the womb. This truth should guide all medical interventions related to fertility. We pray that medical professionals will respect the dignity of every human life, from the moment of conception, and that they will promote treatments that respect both the sanctity of life and the dignity of human sexuality. Let us pray that couples seeking fertility treatment will be guided to ethical options that respect human dignity and that medical professionals will be guided by moral principles in their work.</p>
