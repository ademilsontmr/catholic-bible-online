                Lord God, we thank You and praise You for allowing us to share in Your creative power through the gift of procreation. Please help all married couples who are struggling with the inability to conceive and bear children!

                <strong>Prayer for Submission to God\'s Will:</strong><br/>
                The cross of infertility can be very difficult for couples to bear. When married couples greatly long to be parents, it can be very hard to accept that infertility might be God\'s will in their life.

                We ask You to bless and assist all who are struggling with infertility, and we particularly ask You today to help us to grow in submission to Your will, even when it is very difficult! Help us to grow in all virtues that are necessary for holiness. Help us to rely on Your grace in trials that feel too difficult for us.

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for couples to grow in submission to God\'s will, even when facing the cross of infertility. This is perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of dealing with infertility - accepting that God\'s plan for our family might be different from what we had hoped and prayed for. Luke 22:42 shows us Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He asked the Father to take the cup of suffering from Him, but ultimately submitted to the Father\'s will. This is a model for us when we face difficult circumstances like infertility. We can and should pray for what we desire, but we must also be willing to accept God\'s will if it is different from our own. This submission is not passive resignation, but active trust in God\'s love and wisdom. Let us pray that couples facing infertility will find the grace to submit to God\'s will while maintaining hope in His love.</p>
