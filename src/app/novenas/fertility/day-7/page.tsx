                Many men and women do not have a proper understanding of how their fertility works. A lack of knowledge about fertility can make problems with infertility even more difficult. Better fertility education can help many people who are struggling with infertility.

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for better fertility education in society. Many couples struggling with infertility could benefit from better understanding of how fertility works, including natural family planning methods that can help identify and address fertility issues. Proverbs 1:7 reminds us that true knowledge begins with the fear of the Lord. This means that our understanding of fertility should be grounded in respect for God\'s design and the dignity of human life. Better fertility education can help couples understand their bodies, identify potential issues early, and make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It can also help young people understand the gift of fertility and the importance of respecting it. Let us pray that society will embrace fertility education that respects human dignity and God\'s design for human sexuality.</p>
