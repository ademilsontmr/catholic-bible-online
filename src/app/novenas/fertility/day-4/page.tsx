              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for couples struggling with secondary infertility. Secondary infertility - the inability to conceive after having one or more children - can be particularly confusing and painful. Couples may feel guilty for wanting more children when they already have been blessed with children, or they may feel that their family is incomplete. 1 Samuel 1:27 shows us Hannah\'s joy when God answered her prayer for a child. This reminds us that it is good and natural to desire children, and that God understands this desire. Couples with secondary infertility may also face pressure from others who don't understand why they want more children or who minimize their pain because they already have children. Let us pray that these couples will find understanding and support, and that they will trust in God\'s plan for their family size.</p>
