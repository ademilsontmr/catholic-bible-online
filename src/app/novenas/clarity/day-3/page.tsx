                Today we pray for location in our journey of seeking clarity.
                Location is an essential aspect of discernment that helps us understand God's will for our lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our loving Father, and He wants us to understand His plan for us.
                As our Father, He guides us in growing in location and using this virtue to serve Him better.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Clarity" reminds us that God wants us to understand His will and that we can grow in location
                through our prayer and discernment. He is always available to us, always ready to provide wisdom,
                and always ready to help us make the right decisions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our location.
                Let us ask Him to help us practice this virtue in our discernment journey,
                knowing that He will always guide us and help us grow in holiness.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's guidance is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to help us grow in virtue, and we can practice location completely with His help.
