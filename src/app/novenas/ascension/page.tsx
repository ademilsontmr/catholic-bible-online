              <strong>The Ascension of Jesus</strong> is the event when Jesus, after His Resurrection, 
              ascended into heaven in the presence of His disciples. This glorious event marks Jesus' 
              return to the Father and His enthronement as King of heaven and earth.

              <strong>King of Heaven and Earth</strong> - Jesus ascended to reign as King over all creation. 
              He sits at the right hand of the Father, interceding for us and preparing a place for us 
              in heaven. His Ascension is a promise of our own glorification.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Source of Hope</strong> - The Ascension gives us hope that we too will one day 
              be taken up to heaven. Jesus promised to come again and take us to Himself, where we 
              will share in His eternal joy and triumph.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Model of Transformation</strong> - Jesus' Ascension shows us the transformation 
              that awaits us. From earthly struggle to heavenly glory, from human weakness to divine 
              strength, from temporal life to eternal life.

              <strong>Feast Day</strong> - The Feast of the Ascension is celebrated 40 days after Easter, 
              and this novena is especially popular among those seeking Jesus' intercession for heavenly 
              grace and preparation for eternal life.
