              Jesus promised that He goes to prepare a place for us in His Father's house. This promise gives us confidence that heaven is our true home and that Jesus is actively preparing for our arrival.

              As we reflect on this aspect of Jesus' Ascension and its meaning for our lives, let us ask ourselves how we can 
              apply these lessons to our own spiritual journey and preparation for heaven.

              May Jesus, our ascended King, continue to be our model and intercessor, helping us to prepare for our own 
              eternal destiny and to live lives worthy of the glory that awaits us in heaven.
