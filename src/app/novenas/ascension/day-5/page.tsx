              Jesus offers us His divine friendship and love. When we seek these above all earthly things, we prepare ourselves for union with Him in heaven. His friendship is the greatest treasure we can possess.

              As we reflect on this aspect of Jesus' Ascension and its meaning for our lives, let us ask ourselves how we can 
              apply these lessons to our own spiritual journey and preparation for heaven.

              May Jesus, our ascended King, continue to be our model and intercessor, helping us to prepare for our own 
              eternal destiny and to live lives worthy of the glory that awaits us in heaven.
