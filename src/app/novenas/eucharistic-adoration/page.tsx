            <p className="mb-4">
              Eucharistic Adoration is the practice of spending time in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament, 
              where Jesus is truly present under the appearance of bread and wine. It is a time to adore, 
              worship, and love Jesus in the Eucharist, recognizing that He is truly present - Body, Blood, 
              Soul, and Divinity.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic Church teaches that in the Eucharist, Jesus is truly present in a unique and 
              substantial way. When we adore the Eucharist, we are not adoring bread and wine, but Jesus 
              Himself, who has given us this precious gift as a sign of His love and as spiritual nourishment 
              for our souls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eucharistic Adoration helps us to grow in faith, deepen our relationship with Jesus, and 
              develop a greater appreciation for the gift of the Eucharist. It is a powerful way to draw 
              closer to God and to receive His grace and blessings.
