              St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, known as "The Little Flower," was a French Carmelite nun 
              who lived from 1873 to 1897. She is one of the most beloved saints in the Catholic Church, 
              known for her "Little Way" - a path to holiness through simple, everyday acts of love and trust in God.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              This novena honors St. Th√©r√®se's spiritual approach of doing small things with great love 
              and trusting completely in God's mercy. She promised to spend her heaven doing good on earth, 
              sending down a "shower of roses" to those who ask for her intercession.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              St. Th√©r√®se teaches us that holiness is not about doing great things, but about doing 
              ordinary things with extraordinary love. Her message of spiritual childhood - approaching 
              God with the trust and simplicity of a child - continues to inspire millions around the world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Through this novena, we seek to grow in trust, love, and the grace to follow her Little Way 
              in our daily lives, finding holiness in the ordinary moments and trusting in God's infinite love.

              The devotion to St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux centers on her "Little Way" - a spiritual path 
              that emphasizes doing ordinary things with extraordinary love. Unlike other spiritual 
              approaches that focus on great penances or extraordinary experiences, St. Th√©r√®se's way 
              is accessible to everyone.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Key aspects of devotion to St. Th√©r√®se include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Spiritual Childhood:</strong> Approaching God with the trust and simplicity of a child</li>
              <li><strong>The Little Way:</strong> Finding holiness in small, everyday acts of love</li>
              <li><strong>Confidence in God:</strong> Trusting completely in God's mercy and love</li>
              <li><strong>Hidden Sacrifices:</strong> Offering small sacrifices and inconveniences with love</li>
              <li><strong>Shower of Roses:</strong> Believing in her promise to send spiritual graces from heaven</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              St. Th√©r√®se's autobiography, "Story of a Soul," reveals her spiritual journey and has 
              inspired millions. She was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1997, making her one of 
              only four women to receive this honor.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Her message is particularly relevant today: we don't need to do great things to be holy. 
              We simply need to do everything with love, trusting in God's mercy and following the 
              path of spiritual childhood that leads to heaven.
