              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for those who are having difficulty spreading the Gospel to those around them. Evangelization can be challenging for many reasons - fear of rejection, lack of confidence, uncertainty about how to approach others, or simply the busyness of daily life. 2 Timothy 4:2 reminds us to preach the word in season and out of season, with patience and persistence. This passage encourages us to persevere in our evangelization efforts even when it seems difficult or fruitless. The challenges of evangelization can be both external and internal. External challenges may include hostility from others, cultural barriers, or simply the indifference of those we are trying to reach. Internal challenges may include our own fears, doubts, or feelings of inadequacy. However, we must remember that evangelization is not about our own success or failure, but about being faithful to God's call to share the Gospel. We are called to plant seeds and trust that God will make them grow in His own time and way. Let us pray that those struggling with evangelization will find the courage and strength they need to continue sharing the Gospel with others.</p>
