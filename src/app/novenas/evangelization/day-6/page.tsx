                Dear Lord, we thank You for the gift of Your Church and for Your loving pursuit of all people. Help all who are working to bring more souls to You and Your Church through the work of evangelization.

                <strong>Prayer for Openness to God's Will:</strong><br/>
                The work of evangelization is not always an easy one, and many of us are reluctant to truly follow Your call to preach the Gospel. We are in great need of true openness to Your will in our lives, in order to follow Your call to evangelize others.

                Please bless and assist all who work in evangelization, and we particularly ask You today to help us to grow in openness to Your will! Help us to make growth in virtue the highest priority in our lives. Help us to devote ourselves to serving You more fully each day. And I especially ask in this novena (mention your intentions here).

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for us to grow in openness to God's will in evangelization. The work of evangelization requires a deep surrender to God's will and a willingness to follow His guidance even when it leads us out of our comfort zones. Luke 1:38 shows us the perfect example of openness to God's will in Mary's response to the angel Gabriel: "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." This simple yet profound statement demonstrates complete trust and surrender to God's plan. Mary's openness to God's will allowed her to become the Mother of God and play a crucial role in salvation history. Similarly, our openness to God's will in evangelization can lead to incredible blessings and the salvation of many souls. When we are open to God's will, we become more effective instruments of His grace and more willing to take risks for the sake of the Gospel. This openness requires humility, trust, and a recognition that God's ways are not always our ways. It also means being willing to step out in faith when God calls us to share the Gospel, even if it means facing rejection or difficulty. Let us pray that we may grow in this openness and become more like Mary in our willingness to say "yes" to whatever God asks of us in the work of evangelization.</p>
