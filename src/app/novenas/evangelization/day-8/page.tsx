            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for us to grow in the humility necessary to effectively preach the Gospel. Philippians 2:3-4 reminds us of the importance of humility in our relationships with others. This humility is essential for effective evangelization, as it helps us to approach others with respect and love rather than with a sense of superiority or judgment. Humility in evangelization means recognizing that we are not the saviors of others, but simply instruments of God's grace. It means being willing to listen to others and to learn from them, even as we share the Gospel with them. Humility also means being willing to admit our own weaknesses and failures, and to show others that we are on the same journey of faith as they are. This humility makes us more approachable and credible witnesses to the Gospel. It also helps us to avoid the trap of thinking that our success in evangelization is due to our own efforts rather than to God's grace. Let us pray that we will grow in this humility and that it will make us more effective witnesses to Christ.</p>
