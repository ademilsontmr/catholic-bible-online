              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for lay missionaries who work in evangelization. Lay missionaries play a crucial role in the Church's mission of evangelization, often serving in places and situations where priests and religious cannot go. Acts 8:4 reminds us that after the persecution of the early Church, the faithful were scattered and went about preaching the word. This shows us that evangelization is not just the responsibility of clergy and religious, but of all baptized Christians. Lay missionaries bring the Gospel to their workplaces, neighborhoods, and social circles, often through their daily witness and conversations. They may also serve in formal missionary organizations, traveling to different countries or regions to share the Gospel. Lay missionaries have the advantage of being able to relate to people in their own language and culture, making them effective witnesses to the Gospel. They also serve as bridges between the Church and the secular world, showing how faith can be lived authentically in everyday life. Let us pray that lay missionaries will be faithful to their calling and that they will be effective witnesses to Christ in all they do.</p>
