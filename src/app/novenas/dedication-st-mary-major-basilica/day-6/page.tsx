                Today we pray that all people may grow in holy poverty and detachment. The legend about the holy couple whose wealth built the basilica 
                shows us an example of true detachment from material possessions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                All material goods ultimately come from God, but we should always strive to view them with the detachment of holy poverty. 
                This shows us the beautiful relationship between poverty and holiness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica Novena" reminds us that Mary is our mother and intercessor.
                She is always ready to help us grow in holiness and bring our prayers to Jesus, just as the basilica was dedicated to her honor.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us always view our material possessions as blessings from God.
                Let us ask her to pray that all people may grow in holy poverty and embrace poverty in whatever forms it comes to us in our lives.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that holy poverty is not just about external acts, but about growing in love for God and through detachment from material possessions, 
                growing closer to Jesus. Mary wants to help us on our journey to heaven.
