                Today we pray that all people may grow in charity and service to others. The legend about the origins of the basilica tells us 
                that a wealthy couple decided to put all their money into Mary's service, showing us the importance of charitable works.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Charitable works are an important part of holy living, and Mary's motherly intercession can help us to advance in holiness through this practice. 
                This shows us the beautiful relationship between charity and holiness.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica Novena" reminds us that Mary is our mother and intercessor.
                She is always ready to help us grow in holiness and bring our prayers to Jesus, just as the basilica was dedicated to her honor.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us always serve God as He calls us to.
                Let us ask her to pray that all people may grow in charity and truly strive to grow in the virtues that are necessary for holiness.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that charity and service are not just about external acts, but about growing in love for God and through charitable works, 
                growing closer to Jesus. Mary wants to help us on our journey to heaven.
