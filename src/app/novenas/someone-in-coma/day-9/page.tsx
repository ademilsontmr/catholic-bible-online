                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You and praise You for the gift of health. We humbly ask You today to restore to health all who are in comas, if it be Your will.

              <p className="mb-6">
                We know that You are all powerful and all knowing. You are Love itself, and all that You work in our lives is for our ultimate good even if we do not understand why we are suffering. Even when someone we love is in a coma, we should strive to submit ourselves to Your loving plan.

                Please help all people who are in comas, and we particularly ask today that You help us to grow in submission to Your will.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for growth in submission to God's will. This is the final day of our novena, and we focus 
                on the most important lesson: complete surrender to God's loving plan. When someone we love is in a coma, 
                it can be very difficult to accept God's will, but this is exactly what we are called to do.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Submission to God's will does not mean that we stop praying for healing or that we give up hope. Rather, 
                it means that we trust that God knows what is best for us and for our loved ones. It means that we accept 
                whatever outcome God has planned, even if it is not what we want.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In these situations, we must remember that God is all-powerful and all-knowing. He is Love itself, and 
                everything He does is for our ultimate good. Even when we cannot understand why we are suffering, we must 
                trust in His wisdom and love.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we conclude this novena, let us ask God to help us grow in true friendship with Him. Let us ask Him 
                to help us trust Him deeply, even in times of great suffering. Let us surrender our lives completely to His will.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God never abandons us, even in the most difficult circumstances. He is always present, 
                always loving, and always working for our good.
