                When people enter a coma, it can be difficult to remember that they are still alive and are still the people they once were. Many in our society wish to discount the human dignity of coma patients. You can help all people to grow in respect and love for coma patients.

                Today we pray for recognition of the human dignity of coma patients. When someone enters a coma, it can be 
                easy to forget that they are still a human being with inherent dignity and worth. Society often treats 
                coma patients as if they are no longer fully human.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Every human being, regardless of their state of consciousness, has inherent dignity because they are created 
                in the image and likeness of God. Coma patients are still the same people they were before - they still 
                have the same soul, the same dignity, the same worth.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In these situations, we must remember that God loves every human being equally, regardless of their condition. 
                He sees the dignity and worth of every person, even when we cannot. We must treat coma patients with the 
                same respect and love we would show to any other person.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us see the dignity in every human being. Let us ask Him to help 
                us treat all people with respect and love, regardless of their condition.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God never abandons us, even in the most difficult circumstances. He is always present, 
                always loving, and always working for our good.
