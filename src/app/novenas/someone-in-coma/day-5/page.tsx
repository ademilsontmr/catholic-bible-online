                Today we pray for healthcare workers who care for coma patients. These medical professionals have a very 
                difficult and important job. They must provide constant care and monitoring for patients who cannot respond 
                or communicate with them.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Caring for coma patients requires great skill, patience, and compassion. Healthcare workers must monitor 
                vital signs, provide nutrition, prevent complications, and maintain the patient's dignity and comfort. 
                This work can be emotionally and physically demanding.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In these situations, we must remember that God has blessed these healthcare workers with special gifts 
                and skills. He works through their hands to bring healing and comfort to those who are suffering. 
                We should pray for their strength, wisdom, and compassion.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to give healthcare workers the grace they need to care for coma patients 
                with love and skill. Let us remember that they are God's instruments of healing.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God never abandons us, even in the most difficult medical situations. He is always present, 
                always caring, and always working through the hands of those who care for the sick.
