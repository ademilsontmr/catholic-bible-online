                The gift of Fortitude is essential for the Christian life, as we will inevitably face trials, 
                temptations, and difficulties. In a world that often opposes Christian values and tries to lead 
                us away from God, we need the strength and courage that only the Holy Spirit can provide.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Fortitude is not about being fearless, but about having the courage to do what is right even 
                when we are afraid. It is about standing firm in our faith when others try to shake our beliefs, 
                and about persevering in prayer and good works even when we don't see immediate results.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, ask the Holy Spirit to give you the gift of fortitude. Pray that you may have the strength 
                to overcome all obstacles and to remain faithful to God in all circumstances. Let fortitude help 
                you to persevere in your spiritual journey and to be a witness of God's love and truth.
