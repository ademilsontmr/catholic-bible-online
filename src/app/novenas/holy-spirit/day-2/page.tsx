                The gift of Understanding goes beyond mere intellectual comprehension. It is a spiritual insight 
                that allows us to see with the eyes of faith and to grasp the deeper meaning of God's revelation. 
                When we have understanding, we can read the Scriptures and not just understand the words, 
                but grasp the spiritual truths they contain.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Understanding also helps us to comprehend the mysteries of our faith – the Trinity, the Incarnation, 
                the Eucharist, and other divine mysteries. While we may never fully understand these mysteries 
                with our human minds, the gift of understanding helps us to accept them with faith and to see 
                how they reveal God's love for us.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, ask the Holy Spirit to give you the gift of understanding. Pray that you may grasp 
                the mysteries of faith more deeply and understand God's love for you. Let understanding help 
                you to see God's purpose in the events of your life and to grow in knowledge of Him.
