                The gift of Piety helps us to develop a loving, filial relationship with God. It is not about 
                being overly religious or pious in a superficial way, but about having a genuine love for God 
                and a desire to serve Him and others for His sake.

                Through piety, we come to see God as our loving Father and develop a childlike trust in Him. 
                We find joy in prayer, worship, and serving others, not because we have to, but because we want to. 
                Piety helps us to be grateful for God's gifts and to use them for His glory.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, ask the Holy Spirit to give you the gift of piety. Pray that you may love God with a childlike heart 
                and serve Him with joy and devotion. Let piety help you to develop a deeper relationship with God 
                and to be a witness of His love in the world.
