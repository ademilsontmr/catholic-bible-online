                The gift of Counsel is particularly important in our modern world, where we are constantly 
                faced with difficult decisions and moral choices. In a world that often promotes confusion 
                and relativism, the Holy Spirit's counsel helps us to see clearly what is right and what is wrong.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Counsel also enables us to be good advisors to others. When people come to us for guidance, 
                we can offer them sound advice based on God's truth rather than worldly wisdom. This gift 
                helps us to be instruments of the Holy Spirit in guiding others toward holiness and salvation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, ask the Holy Spirit to give you the gift of counsel. Pray that you may make wise decisions 
                in your own life and be able to guide others with sound advice. Let counsel help you to discern 
                God's will and to choose what leads to holiness and eternal life.
