          <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray with deep trust in God's care and provision. 
                Trust is a virtue that opens our hearts to receive more blessings from God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus' teaching about the birds of the air (Matthew 6:26) is a beautiful example of trust. He reminds us that 
                if God cares for the birds, how much more will He care for us, His beloved children. Our trust flows from our deep love for God and our recognition of His goodness.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we complete this novena, let us thank God for His abundant blessings and His constant care. 
                Let us thank Him for being our Father and for always being ready to provide for us in all our needs.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Trust helps us to recognize the many blessings we receive and to appreciate the love and care 
                that God shows us. When we trust, we become more aware of God's presence in our lives 
                and more open to receiving His graces.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that trust is not just about believing but about living with a trusting heart. 
                Let us ask God to help us cultivate this virtue and to always trust in His abundant blessings.
