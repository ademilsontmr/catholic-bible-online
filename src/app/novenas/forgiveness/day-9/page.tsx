                Today we pray for the grace to achieve complete forgiveness in our hearts.
                Complete forgiveness means letting go of all bitterness, resentment, and anger.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus teaches us in Matthew 6:14-15 that "if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."

                The title "Forgiveness Novena" reminds us that God is our ultimate model of forgiveness.
                He is always ready to help us forgive as He has forgiven us, and to grow in the virtue of forgiveness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we complete this novena, let us ask God to grant us complete forgiveness.
                Let us ask Him to help us understand that forgiveness is a complete gift that brings freedom and peace.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that complete forgiveness is a gift from God that brings true freedom and allows us to live in peace and joy.
