                Today we pray for the grace to trust completely in God's ability to help us forgive.
                Trust in God is essential for forgiveness because it helps us believe that He can work miracles in our hearts.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus teaches us in Matthew 19:26 that "with God all things are possible."
                This reminds us that even the most difficult forgiveness is possible with God's help.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Forgiveness Novena" reminds us that God is our ultimate model of forgiveness.
                He is always ready to help us forgive as He has forgiven us, and to grow in the virtue of forgiveness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to strengthen our trust in Him.
                Let us ask Him to help us believe that He can work miracles of forgiveness in our hearts.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that trusting in God means believing that He can do what seems impossible to us, including helping us forgive those who have hurt us deeply.
