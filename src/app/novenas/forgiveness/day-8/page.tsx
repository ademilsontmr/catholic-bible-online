                Today we pray for the grace to find true peace and reconciliation through forgiveness.
                Peace is the fruit of forgiveness, and reconciliation is the restoration of relationships.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus teaches us in John 14:27 that He gives us peace, "not as the world gives."
                This reminds us that true peace comes from God and is found through forgiveness and reconciliation.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Forgiveness Novena" reminds us that God is our ultimate model of forgiveness.
                He is always ready to help us forgive as He has forgiven us, and to grow in the virtue of forgiveness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to grant us peace and reconciliation.
                Let us ask Him to help us understand that forgiveness is the path to true peace.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that peace and reconciliation are gifts from God that come when we choose to forgive and allow His grace to work in our hearts.
