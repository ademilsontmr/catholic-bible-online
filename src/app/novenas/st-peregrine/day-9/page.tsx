                <strong>Glorious wonder-worker, St. Peregrine,</strong> you answered the divine call with a ready spirit, 
                and forsook all the comforts of a life of ease and all the empty honors of the world to dedicate 
                yourself to God in the Order of His holy Mother.

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>You labored manfully for the salvation of souls.</strong> In union with Jesus crucified, 
                you endured painful sufferings with such patience as to deserve to be healed miraculously of an 
                incurable cancer in your leg by a touch of His divine hand.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Obtain for me the grace to answer every call of God</strong> and to fulfill His will in all 
                the events of life. Enkindle in my heart a consuming zeal for the salvation of all men.

                so that, imitating our crucified Savior and His sorrowful Mother, I may merit eternal glory in heaven.

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O great St. Peregrine,</strong> you have been called 'The Mighty,' 'The Wonder-Worker,' 
                because of the numerous miracles which you have obtained from God for those who have had recourse to you.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>For so many years you bore in your own flesh</strong> this cancerous disease that destroys 
                the very fibre of our being, and who had recourse to the source of all grace when the power of man 
                could do no more. You were favoured with the vision of Jesus coming down from His Cross to heal your affliction.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Ask of God and Our Lady,</strong> the cure of the sick whom we entrust to you.
                (Pause here and silently recall the names of the sick for whom you are praying)
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Aided in this way by your powerful intercession,</strong> we shall sing to God, now and for all eternity, 
                a song of gratitude for His great goodness and mercy.
