            On this final day of the Divine Mercy Novena, we pray for the souls who have become lukewarm in their faith. 
            These are souls who have lost their fervor and zeal for God, who have become indifferent or complacent in their spiritual life. 
            We ask Jesus to rekindle their love and to restore their passion for Him.

                <strong>Opening Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Most Merciful Jesus, whose very nature it is to have compassion on us and to forgive us, 
                do not look upon our sins but upon our trust which we place in Your infinite goodness. 
                Receive us all into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart, and never let us escape from It. 
                We beg this of You by Your love which unites You to the Father and the Holy Spirit.

                <strong>Prayer for Lukewarm Souls:</strong><br/>
                Most Compassionate Jesus, You are Compassion Itself. I bring lukewarm souls into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart. 
                In this fire of Your pure love, let these tepid souls, who, like corpses, filled You with such deep loathing, 
                be once again set aflame. O Most Compassionate Jesus, exercise the omnipotence of Your mercy and draw them into the very ardor of Your love, 
                and bestow upon them the gift of holy love, for nothing is beyond Your power.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Fire and ice cannot be joined; either the fire dies, or the ice melts. But by Your mercy, O God, 
                You can make up for all that is lacking. Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon lukewarm souls, 
                who are nonetheless enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Father of Mercy, I beg You by the bitter Passion of Your Son 
                and by His three-hour agony on the Cross: Let them, too, glorify the abyss of Your mercy. Amen.

                Jesus, I trust in You. Thank You for these nine days of prayer and for all the graces You have given me. 
                Help me to never become lukewarm in my love for You, but to always burn with zeal for Your glory. Amen.

                Lukewarmness is a dangerous spiritual condition. It's not that these souls are completely cold or have abandoned God, 
                but they have lost their fervor and zeal. They may still go to Mass, say their prayers, and perform good works, 
                but their hearts are not fully engaged. They have become complacent and indifferent.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus has a special concern for lukewarm souls because He knows that lukewarmness can easily lead to spiritual death. 
                He wants to rekindle their love and restore their passion for Him. Through our prayers, we can help these souls 
                rediscover the fire of God's love and return to a vibrant relationship with Him.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As we complete this novena, let us examine our own hearts. Are we lukewarm in any area of our spiritual life? 
                Do we need Jesus to rekindle our love for Him? Let us ask Him to set our hearts on fire with love for Him 
                and to help us become instruments of His mercy in the world.
