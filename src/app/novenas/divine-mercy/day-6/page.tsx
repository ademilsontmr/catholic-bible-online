                <strong>Opening Prayer:</strong><br/>
                Most Merciful Jesus, You Yourself have said, "Learn from Me for I am meek and humble of heart." 
                Receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart all meek and humble souls and the souls of little children. 
                These souls send all heaven into ecstasy and they are the heavenly Father's favorites. 
                They are a sweet-smelling bouquet before the throne of God; God Himself takes delight in their fragrance. 
                These souls have a permanent abode in Your Most Compassionate Heart, O Jesus, and they unceasingly sing out a hymn of love and mercy.

                O omnipotence of Divine Mercy, help of those who are falling, raise up all who have fallen, 
                and assist those who rise. Let all who recognize the warmth of Your Heart feel the effects of Your mercy. 
                Do not look upon how many, but upon what love and what repentance they bring with them.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon meek and humble souls and upon the souls of little children, 
                who are enfolded in the abode which is the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. These souls bear the closest resemblance to Your Son. 
                Their fragrance rises from the earth and reaches Your very throne. Father of mercy and of all goodness, 
                I beg You by the love You bear these souls and by the delight You take in them: Bless the whole world, 
                that all souls together may sing out the praises of Your mercy for endless ages. Amen.

                Today we pray for the humble and little souls - those who trust completely in God's mercy and love. 
                These souls are like children who depend entirely on their Father, and Jesus has a special love for them.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus tells us to "become like little children" (Matthew 18:3). What does this mean? 
                It means we should trust God completely, just as a child trusts their parent. 
                It means we should be humble, recognizing our dependence on God and our need for His mercy.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The humble and little souls are those who don't rely on their own strength or wisdom, 
                but who put all their trust in God. They are like the poor in spirit that Jesus calls blessed. 
                They know they need God's mercy and they receive it with gratitude and love.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us become more like these humble and little souls. 
                Let us learn to trust Him completely, to depend on His mercy, and to love Him with childlike simplicity.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that Jesus said, "Learn from Me for I am meek and humble of heart" (Matthew 11:29). 
                Let us learn from Him and become more like Him in our humility and trust.
