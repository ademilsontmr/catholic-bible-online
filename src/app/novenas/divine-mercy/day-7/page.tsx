                Most Merciful Jesus, whose Heart is Love Itself, receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart 
                the souls of those who particularly extol and venerate the greatness of Your mercy. 
                These souls are mighty with the very power of God Himself. In the midst of all afflictions and adversities 
                they go forward, confident of Your mercy; and united to You, O Jesus, they carry all mankind on their shoulders. 
                These souls will not be judged severely, but Your mercy will embrace them as they depart from this life.

                O omnipotence of Divine Mercy, help of those who are falling, raise up all who have fallen, 
                and assist those who rise. Let all who recognize the warmth of Your Heart feel the effects of Your mercy. 
                Do not look upon how many, but upon what love and what repentance they bring with them.

                Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls who glorify and venerate Your greatest attribute, 
                that of Your unfathomable mercy, and who are enclosed in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. 
                These souls are a living Gospel; their hands are full of deeds of mercy, and their hearts, overflowing with joy, 
                sing a canticle of mercy to You, O Most High! I beg You O God: Show them Your mercy according to the hope and trust 
                they have placed in You. Let there be accomplished in them the promise of Jesus, who said to them that during their life, 
                but especially at the hour of death, the souls who will venerate this fathomless mercy of His, He, Himself, will defend 
                as His glory. Amen.

                Today we pray for those who venerate and glorify God's mercy - those who are like a choir of angels 
                singing the praises of God's mercy and helping others to trust in His love.

                These souls are "mighty with the very power of God Himself." What does this mean? 
                It means that when we venerate and glorify God's mercy, we become channels of His power and love. 
                We become instruments through which God can work in the world.

                These souls "carry all mankind on their shoulders." This means they pray for and intercede for others. 
                They don't just think about themselves, but they bring the needs of the whole world before God's throne of mercy.

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God to help us become more like these souls who venerate and glorify His mercy. 
                Let us learn to sing the praises of His mercy, to trust in His love, and to be instruments of His mercy to others.

                Remember that Jesus promised to defend as His glory those who venerate His mercy, especially at the hour of death. 
                Let us trust in this promise and make it our mission to glorify God's mercy in everything we do.
