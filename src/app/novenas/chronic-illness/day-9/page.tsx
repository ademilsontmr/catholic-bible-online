              <p className="mb-6">Those who suffer from chronic illness endure many sufferings, and they often face many temptations to despair and to turn away from God. Those who suffer from chronic illness are in great need of the grace of perseverance.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for perseverance for those who suffer from chronic illness. Perseverance is perhaps the most important virtue for those who face long-term suffering.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Those who suffer from chronic illness must persevere day after day, month after month, year after year. They must continue to fight, to hope, to trust, and to love even when the suffering seems endless and the future uncertain.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Perseverance is not just about enduring suffering, but about continuing to grow in faith, hope, and love despite the suffering. It's about refusing to give up on God, on others, or on oneself.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for them today, let us remember that perseverance is a gift from God. He wants to give those who suffer the grace they need to continue fighting and to continue growing in holiness.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Let us ask God to help all those who suffer from chronic illness to persevere in their faith, their hope, and their love. May they find the strength they need to continue their journey with courage and trust.</p>
