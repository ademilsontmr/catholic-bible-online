              <p className="mb-6">Poverty is a great difficulty for all who endure it. But for the poor who suffer from chronic illness, poverty can be an even more severe burden. The poor who suffer from chronic illness are often unable to get all the help they need.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for the poor who suffer from chronic illness. Poverty and chronic illness together create a particularly difficult situation that can seem overwhelming and hopeless.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">The poor who suffer from chronic illness face unique challenges. They may not have access to adequate medical care, medications, or treatments. They may struggle to afford healthy food, transportation to medical appointments, or basic necessities. They may have to choose between paying for medical care and paying for food or housing.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">These individuals need God's grace to find the help and resources they need. They need strength to advocate for themselves, wisdom to make difficult decisions about their health and finances, and hope to keep going even when the situation seems impossible.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for them today, let us remember that God has a special concern for the poor and the suffering. He wants to help them find the resources and support they need, and He wants to work through others to provide this help.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Let us ask God to help all poor people who suffer from chronic illness to find the medical care, financial assistance, and support they need. May they find hope and help in their difficult situation.</p>
