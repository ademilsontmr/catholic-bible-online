                <strong>O Lord Jesus Christ, who said, 'greater love than this no man has that a man lay down his life for his friends,' through the intercession of St. Maximilian Kolbe whose life illustrated such love, we beseech you to grant us our petitions...</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>For the Grace to Love Our Lady and Fellow Man as Generously as St. Kolbe Did</strong>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Through the Militia Immaculata movement, which Maximilian founded, he spread a fervent devotion to Our Lady throughout the world. He gave up his life for a total stranger and loved his persecutors, giving us an example of unselfish love for all men - a love that was inspired by true devotion to Mary.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Grant, O Lord Jesus, that we too may give ourselves entirely without reserve to the love and service of our Heavenly Queen in order to better love and serve our fellowman in imitation of your humble servant, Maximilian. Amen.

                <strong>Prayer to St. Maximilian Kolbe</strong><br/>
                O St. Maximilian Kolbe, faithful follower of St. Francis, inflamed by the love of God you dedicated your life to the practice of virtue and to works of the apostolate. Look down with favor upon us who devoutly confide in your intercession. Having consecrated yourself to the Immaculate Virgin Mary, you inspired countless souls to a holy life and various forms of the apostolate in order to do good to others and to spread the kingdom of God. Obtain for us the grace by our lives and labors to draw many souls to Christ. In your close conformity to our Divine Savior you reached such an intense degree of love that you offered your life to save a fellow prisoner. Implore God that we, inflamed by such ardent charity, may through our living faith and our apostolic works witness Christ to others, and thus merit to join you in the blessed vision of God. Amen.
