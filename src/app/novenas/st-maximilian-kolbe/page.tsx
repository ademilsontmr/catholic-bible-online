              The Novena to Saint Maximilian Kolbe is a powerful nine-day prayer that helps us grow closer to God 
              through the intercession of this great saint and martyr. St. Maximilian Kolbe was a Polish Franciscan 
              friar who gave his life for a stranger in Auschwitz concentration camp.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              St. Maximilian's life was marked by his deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, his founding of 
              the Militia Immaculata movement, and his ultimate sacrifice of love. He exemplified the words of 
              Jesus: "Greater love than this no man has that a man lay down his life for his friends."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This novena helps us to trust in St. Maximilian's powerful intercession and to turn to him with 
              confidence in every need, especially for the grace to love God and neighbor more generously.

              <strong>Martyr of Charity</strong> - In Auschwitz, when a prisoner was selected for execution,
