                <strong>Meditation</strong><br/>
                Catherine lived a hidden life of service. Even after her visions became known, she never sought recognition or honor. For more than forty years, she quietly cared for the elderly and infirm, finding Christ in every soul.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Her sanctity was rooted in ordinary acts of love, done with extraordinary faith.

                <strong>Prayer</strong><br/>
                Lord, teach me the value of humility and the power of small acts of love. May I serve without seeking praise, offering everything for Your glory.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                St. Catherine, obtain for me the grace to love others patiently and tenderly. Help me see Christ in the poor, the sick, and the forgotten.

                Today we meditate on Catherine's hidden life of service and her care for the elderly and infirm. 
                We learn about the value of humility and small acts of love.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Catherine shows us that true holiness is found not in grand gestures but in the daily practice of love and service. 
                She teaches us to serve without seeking praise and to offer everything for God's glory.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask St. Catherine to help us persevere in our duties, even when unseen or unappreciated. 
                Let us also ask her to help us grow in humility and charity.
              </p>

              <p>
                St. Catherine's example reminds us that we can find Christ in the poor, the sick, and the forgotten. 
                Through her intercession, may we learn to love others patiently and tenderly, just as she did.
