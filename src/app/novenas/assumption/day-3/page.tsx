                Mary, Queen Assumed into Heaven, I rejoice that after years of heroic martyrdom on earth, you have at last been taken to the throne prepared for you in heaven by the Holy Trinity.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Lift my heart with you in the glory of your Assumption above the dreadful touch of sin and impurity. Teach me how small earth becomes when viewed from heaven. Make me realize that death is the triumphant gate through which I shall pass to your Son, and that someday my body shall rejoin my soul in the unending bliss of heaven.

              <p>
                When my hour of death has come, lead me safely to the presence of Jesus to enjoy the vision of my God for all eternity together with you.

              Mary's throne in heaven was prepared for her by the Holy Trinity as a reward for her faithfulness. This reminds us that God has prepared a place for each of us in heaven, and we must live our lives in preparation for that glorious day.

              As we reflect on this aspect of Mary's Assumption and its meaning for our lives, let us ask ourselves how we can 
              apply these lessons to our own spiritual journey and preparation for heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
              May Mary, Queen Assumed into Heaven, continue to be our model and intercessor, helping us to prepare for our own 
              eternal destiny and to live lives worthy of the glory that awaits us in heaven.
