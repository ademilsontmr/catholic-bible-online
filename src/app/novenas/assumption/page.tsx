              <strong>The Assumption of Mary</strong> is the Catholic dogma that teaches that Mary, the Mother of God, 
              was taken body and soul into heaven at the end of her earthly life. This glorious event 
              is a sign of hope for all Christians, showing us our own destiny.

              <strong>Queen of Heaven</strong> - Mary, as Queen Assumed into Heaven, reigns with her Son Jesus Christ. 
              She intercedes for us before the throne of God and helps us prepare for our own heavenly 
              destiny. Her Assumption is a promise of our own resurrection.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Source of Hope</strong> - The Assumption gives us hope that our bodies too will one day 
              be glorified and reunited with our souls in heaven. Mary's Assumption is a preview of 
              what awaits all the faithful.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Model of Perseverance</strong> - Mary's Assumption shows us the reward for a life of 
              faithfulness to God. After years of heroic martyrdom on earth, she was taken to the 
              throne prepared for her in heaven.

            <p>
              <strong>Feast Day</strong> - The Feast of the Assumption is celebrated on August 15th, and this 
              novena is especially popular among those seeking Mary's intercession for heavenly grace 
              and preparation for eternal life.
