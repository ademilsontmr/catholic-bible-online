            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students to grow in true humility as they work toward graduation. This day reminds us that humility is an essential virtue for success in any endeavor, including education.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">True humility is not about thinking less of ourselves, but about thinking of ourselves less. It is about recognizing our limitations and weaknesses while also acknowledging our gifts and talents. It is about being open to learning from others, accepting correction and feedback, and recognizing that we don't have all the answers.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">For college students, humility is particularly important because it enables them to be teachable. Humble students are willing to admit when they don't understand something, ask for help when they need it, and learn from their mistakes. They are also able to work well with others, accept constructive criticism, and recognize the value of different perspectives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Humility also helps students maintain a healthy perspective on their education. It prevents them from becoming arrogant about their achievements or discouraged by their failures. It helps them focus on learning and growing rather than just getting good grades or impressing others.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those working toward graduation, let us ask God to help them grow in true humility. Let us pray that they will develop the teachable spirit they need to succeed in their studies. Let us also pray that they will learn to value learning for its own sake and to use their education to serve others.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that humility is the foundation of all other virtues. With God's grace, students can develop this essential quality and use it to grow not only academically but spiritually as well.</p>
