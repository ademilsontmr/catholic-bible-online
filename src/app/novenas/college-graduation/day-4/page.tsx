              <p className="mb-6">Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for giving us the gift of education. We ask You to pour out Your grace on all college students who are on their journey to graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Completing a college education can be very difficult at times. The efforts of college students as they work toward graduation can be so great that they feel exhausted. You can help all college students who are struggling with exhaustion as they work toward their graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">We ask You to please bless and assist all college students who are trying to graduate, and we particularly ask today that You assist all college students who feel exhausted as they work toward graduation.</p>

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students who feel exhausted as they work toward graduation. This day reminds us that the effort required to complete a college education can be overwhelming and physically, mentally, and emotionally draining.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">College students often face tremendous pressure to perform well academically while balancing other responsibilities such as work, family obligations, and social activities. The constant demands on their time and energy can lead to exhaustion, burnout, and a feeling of being overwhelmed. This exhaustion can make it difficult to continue their studies and maintain their motivation.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">However, God can help students overcome this exhaustion and find the strength they need to continue. He can renew their energy, restore their motivation, and give them the perseverance to keep going even when they feel tired and overwhelmed.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those who are exhausted, let us ask God to give them the rest and renewal they need. Let us pray that they will find healthy ways to manage their stress and take care of themselves. Let us also pray that they will learn to offer their sufferings to God and find meaning in their struggles.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that exhaustion is a sign that we are pushing ourselves to our limits, but God's strength is unlimited. With His grace, students can find the energy and determination they need to complete their education.</p>
