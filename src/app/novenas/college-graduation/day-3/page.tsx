              <p className="mb-6">Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for giving us the gift of education. We ask You to pour out Your grace on all college students who are on their journey to graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">The path to graduating from college can be very difficult for some students. Like all difficult things we do in our lives, working toward graduation can be a source of discouragement at times. You can help all college students who are facing discouragement as they work toward graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">We ask You to please bless and assist all college students who are trying to graduate, and we particularly ask today that You assist all college students who are discouraged as they work toward graduating college.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students who are discouraged as they work toward graduating college. This day reminds us that the path to graduation can be very difficult and challenging for many students.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Discouragement is a common experience during the college journey. Students may feel overwhelmed by the workload, frustrated by poor grades, or disheartened by setbacks and failures. They may question whether they have what it takes to succeed or if all their efforts are worth it. This discouragement can be a major obstacle to completing their education.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">However, with God's grace, all discouragement can be overcome. God understands our struggles and is always ready to help us when we turn to Him. He can give us the strength to persevere, the hope to continue, and the courage to face our challenges with determination.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those who are discouraged, let us ask God to lift their spirits and renew their motivation. Let us pray that they will find the strength to continue their studies and the confidence to believe in their ability to succeed. Let us also pray that they will turn to God in their difficulties and find comfort and support in His love.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that discouragement is temporary, but God's love and support are eternal. With His grace, students can overcome any obstacle and achieve their educational goals.</p>
