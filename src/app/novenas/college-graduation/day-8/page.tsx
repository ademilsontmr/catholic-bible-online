              <p className="mb-6">Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for giving us the gift of education. We ask You to pour out Your grace on all college students who are on their journey to graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">You call each of us to an intimate relationship with You. It can sometimes be difficult to keep our relationship with You in mind as we perform difficult work. For Your glory and our own sanctification, we should always strive to offer up to You all that we do.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">We ask You to please bless and assist all college students who are trying to graduate, and we particularly ask today that You help all college students to grow in the ability to offer up to You all that they do.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students to grow in the ability to offer up to God all that they do. This day reminds us that everything we do can be an opportunity to grow closer to God and to serve Him.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Offering our work to God means dedicating our efforts to His glory and asking Him to bless and guide our actions. It means recognizing that our talents and abilities are gifts from God and using them to serve Him and others. It means finding meaning and purpose in even the most mundane tasks by doing them for God.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">For college students, this can mean offering their studies to God - asking Him to bless their learning, guide their research, and help them use their education to serve others. It can mean offering their struggles and difficulties to God, asking Him to help them grow through their challenges. It can mean offering their successes to God, thanking Him for His help and guidance.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">When students learn to offer everything to God, their education becomes not just an academic pursuit but a spiritual journey. They begin to see their studies as a way to grow in wisdom and knowledge that can be used to serve God and others. They find greater meaning and purpose in their work, even when it is difficult or challenging.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those working toward graduation, let us ask God to help them grow in the ability to offer everything to Him. Let us pray that they will learn to dedicate their studies and efforts to His glory. Let us also pray that they will develop a deeper relationship with God through their educational journey.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that offering our work to God transforms it from a burden into a blessing. With God's grace, students can learn to offer everything to Him and find greater joy and meaning in their educational journey.</p>
