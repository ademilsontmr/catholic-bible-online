            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students to grow in submission to God's will as they work toward graduation. This day reminds us that accepting God's will in our lives is not always easy, especially when we face difficulties and challenges.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Submission to God's will means recognizing that God has a plan for our lives and trusting that His plan is better than our own. It means accepting the circumstances we find ourselves in, even when they are difficult, and working within them to achieve our goals. It means letting go of our own desires and preferences when they conflict with what God wants for us.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">For college students, this can mean accepting that their educational journey may not go exactly as they planned. They may need to take courses they don't enjoy, work with professors they find challenging, or face setbacks that delay their graduation. Learning to accept these circumstances as part of God's plan can bring peace and help them focus on what they can control.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those working toward graduation, let us ask God to help them grow in submission to His will. Let us pray that they will learn to trust in His plan for their lives and find peace in accepting the circumstances they face. Let us also pray that they will develop the humility to recognize that God's ways are higher than their own.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that submission to God's will is not about giving up or being passive, but about actively working within God's plan to achieve our goals. With God's grace, students can learn to submit to His will and find greater peace and success in their educational journey.</p>
