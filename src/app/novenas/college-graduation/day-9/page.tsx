              <p className="mb-6">Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for giving us the gift of education. We ask You to pour out Your grace on all college students who are on their journey to graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Many things we do in our lives are filled with suffering and difficulties. College students working toward graduation often face a lot of suffering in many ways. You can help us to grow in the ability to make holy use of all sufferings we endure in our lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">We ask You to please bless and assist all college students who are trying to graduate, and we particularly ask today that You help all college students to grow in the ability to make holy use of their sufferings.</p>

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students to grow in the ability to make holy use of their sufferings. This final day of our novena reminds us that suffering is a part of life, but it can be transformed into something meaningful and redemptive when offered to God.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Making holy use of suffering means recognizing that our difficulties and challenges can be opportunities for spiritual growth and transformation. It means offering our sufferings to God and asking Him to use them for our sanctification and for the good of others. It means finding meaning and purpose in our struggles rather than just enduring them.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">For college students, this can mean offering their academic struggles, exhaustion, discouragement, and other difficulties to God. It can mean asking God to use these challenges to help them grow in virtue, develop character, and become more compassionate toward others who are struggling. It can mean finding meaning in their suffering by offering it for the intentions of others.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">When students learn to make holy use of their sufferings, their educational journey becomes not just about earning a degree but about growing in holiness. They begin to see their challenges as opportunities for spiritual growth and their difficulties as ways to draw closer to God. They find greater meaning and purpose in their struggles.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we conclude this novena, let us pray for all college students to grow in the ability to make holy use of their sufferings. Let us ask God to help them transform their difficulties into opportunities for spiritual growth. Let us also pray that they will learn to offer their sufferings for the good of others and for the glory of God.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that suffering is not meaningless when offered to God. With His grace, students can learn to make holy use of their sufferings and find greater meaning and purpose in their educational journey.</p>
