              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for giving us the gift of education. We ask You to pour out Your grace on all college students who are on their journey to graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Working toward college graduation can require a lot of effort. College students often must persevere through a great amount of difficulty in order to be able to graduate. You can help college students to grow in the perseverance they need to be able to graduate.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">We ask You to please bless and assist all college students who are trying to graduate, and we particularly ask today that You help all college students to grow in the perseverance they need as they work toward graduation.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Help us to grow in every virtue we need for holiness. Give us the grace to do whatever is necessary to become saints.</p>

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all college students to grow in the perseverance they need as they work toward graduation. This day reminds us that completing a college education requires sustained effort and determination over a long period of time.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Perseverance is the virtue that enables us to continue working toward our goals even when we face obstacles, setbacks, and difficulties. It is the quality that keeps us going when we want to give up, that helps us maintain our focus when we are distracted, and that gives us the strength to overcome challenges.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">College students need this virtue in abundance as they work toward graduation. They must persevere through difficult courses, challenging assignments, disappointing grades, and the many other obstacles that can arise during their educational journey. Without perseverance, it is easy to become discouraged and give up.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">However, with God's grace, students can develop this important virtue. God can give them the strength to continue when they feel like quitting, the determination to keep working when they face setbacks, and the patience to endure the long process of earning their degree.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those working toward graduation, let us ask God to help them grow in perseverance. Let us pray that they will develop the determination and resilience they need to complete their education. Let us also pray that they will learn to rely on God's strength when their own strength is insufficient.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that perseverance is not just about enduring difficulties, but about growing stronger through them. With God's grace, students can develop this virtue and use it not only in their education but throughout their lives.</p>
