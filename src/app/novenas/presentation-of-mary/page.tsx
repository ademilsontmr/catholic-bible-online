              The Presentation of Mary celebrates the moment when the Blessed Virgin Mary was presented in the Temple by her parents, 
              Saints Joachim and Anne. According to tradition, Mary\'s parents had promised to dedicate their child to God if He 
              would grant them the gift of parenthood after years of infertility.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When Mary was about three years old, she was taken to the Temple in Jerusalem to be dedicated to God\'s service. 
              There, she would live among the holy men and women who served in the Temple, learning about God\'s word and growing 
              in holiness. This presentation marked the beginning of Mary\'s dedicated service to God and prepared her for her 
              future role as the Mother of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this novena, we honor Mary\'s presentation and seek her powerful intercession to help us say yes to God\'s will, 
              support His priests, study His word, and grow in dedication to His service, just as Mary did from her earliest years.
