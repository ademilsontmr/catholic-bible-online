              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Mary, this world scares me sometimes.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">It's so full of sin! Everywhere I turn, there is something going on that frightens my soul. </p>

              <p className="mb-4">In this era, it is so easy to fall into sin. The culture makes sin look desirable and easy! I don't want to fall into sin, but I do sometimes.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">I wonder what the world was like when you were presented, O Mary. I bet it was also filled with sin, just like today. It might look different, but I bet it was still there. </p>

              <p className="mb-4">I wonder that's one of the reasons why Sts. Anne and Joachim had you presented and dedicated the Temple. They wanted to protect you from the world of sin. Of course, they didn't have to worry about that for you. You were born without sin!</p>

              <p className="mb-4">I think that makes you the best candidate to help me avoid it! Mary, please help me to resist temptation. When I am faced with sin, help me to say no to it and yes to God, just like you did. Pray that, over time, I will become stronger at resisting sin.</p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Please also ask that you keep in mind my intentions:</strong>

                Today we focus on resisting temptation. This aspect of honoring The Presentation of Mary helps us to grow in dedication to God 
                and to become more like Christ in our daily lives as we seek to serve Him and His priests.

                As we continue our Presentation of Mary Novena, let us remember that Mary's presentation in the Temple marked the beginning 
                of her dedicated service to God, and she can help us do the same.

              <p>
                Let us ask Mary to help us be instruments of her love and grace in serving God, imitating her perfect example of dedication 
                and willingness to say yes to God's will.
