              <p className="mb-4">Mary, we do not know if you were physically presented and dedicated in the Temple. However, your devotion to God was certainly very strong throughout your life.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Your greatest "yes" of course was saying yes to being the mother of the Messiah at the Annunciation. But you continued to say "yes" to God's crazy plans throughout the rest of your life. You gave birth in a stable. You had to run away to Egypt. You lost Jesus in the Temple. You watched Jesus perform miracles and be mocked. You even had to say "yes" to watching Him die on the cross.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">You are the model of saying "yes" to God's crazy will, even when you don't fully understand it.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Can you help me to do the same? I want to speak that unrelenting "yes." I want to believe and trust that God knows what's best, even when I can't see it. I want to be able to effect change as you did.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">When you were presented to God in the Temple as a girl, you had no idea what lay ahead through that commitment. I don't either. But I want to make that dedication anyway.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Please help me, Mary. Help me to trust God, help me to overcome my fears and doubts.</p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Please also ask that you keep in mind my intentions:</strong>

                <strong>O God, I want to come to know and love You better. Thank You for all of the blessings in my life. Help me to continue to say yes to Your will!</strong>

                Today we focus on saying yes to god. This aspect of honoring The Presentation of Mary helps us to grow in dedication to God 
                and to become more like Christ in our daily lives as we seek to serve Him and His priests.

                As we continue our Presentation of Mary Novena, let us remember that Mary's presentation in the Temple marked the beginning 
                of her dedicated service to God, and she can help us do the same.

              <p>
                Let us ask Mary to help us be instruments of her love and grace in serving God, imitating her perfect example of dedication 
                and willingness to say yes to God's will.
