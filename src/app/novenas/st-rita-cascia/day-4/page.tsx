                Today we pray for the conversion of sinners. May we learn from St. Rita's example to pray for those who have hurt us 
                and for all who have strayed from God. Help us to have a great love for souls and to desire their salvation 
                as much as our own.

                St. Rita's prayer for the conversion of her husband's murderers shows us the true meaning of Christian love. 
                Instead of seeking revenge, she prayed for their salvation. This is the kind of love that Jesus showed on the cross 
                when He prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today, let us ask St. Rita to help us grow in love for souls. Think about the people in your life 
                who may have strayed from God or who are living in sin. Pray for their conversion, not out of judgment, 
                but out of love for their souls and desire for their eternal happiness.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                St. Rita teaches us that true love means wanting what is best for others, even when they have hurt us. 
                The greatest gift we can give someone is to pray for their salvation.
