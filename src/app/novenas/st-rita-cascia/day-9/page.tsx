              As we complete this novena to St. Rita, let us reflect on the journey we have taken together. 
              We have prayed for patience, forgiveness, perseverance, conversion, peace, impossible causes, 
              suffering, miracles, and complete trust. Through each day, we have grown closer to St. Rita 
              and learned to trust more deeply in God's power and love.

            <p className="mb-4">
              St. Rita's life teaches us that with God, nothing is impossible. She faced many trials and difficulties, 
              yet through prayer and trust in God, she overcame them all. Her example shows us that we too can face 
              our impossible situations with confidence, knowing that God is with us and that St. Rita is interceding for us.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Continue to pray to St. Rita with confidence, and trust that she will help you with all your needs. 
              Remember that the novena may be over, but St. Rita's intercession continues. Keep her close to your heart 
              and turn to her whenever you need help with impossible causes.
