              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray to grow in gratitude for the gift of sacramental grace. This day reminds us of the incredible gift that the sacraments are and the grace that God pours out through them.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Baptism is not just a ceremony or tradition, but a sacrament that brings about real spiritual effects. Through baptism, God places a permanent character on our soul, makes us His children, and gives us sanctifying grace. This is an incredible gift that we should never take for granted.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Sacramental grace is the special help that God gives us through the sacraments to live as Christians and grow in holiness. It is a gift that we receive not because we deserve it, but because of God's love and mercy. We should be deeply grateful for this gift and strive to make good use of it.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those preparing for baptism, let us ask God to help them understand the incredible gift they are about to receive. Let us pray that they will grow in gratitude for this sacramental grace and will strive to make good use of it in their lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that gratitude is a virtue that opens our hearts to receive more graces. When we are grateful for the gifts God has given us, we become more open to receiving His love and mercy. With God's grace, we can all grow in this virtue and become more grateful for all His blessings.</p>
