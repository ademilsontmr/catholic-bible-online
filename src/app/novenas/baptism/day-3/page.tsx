              <p className="mb-4">God's laws are not arbitrary rules, but guidelines that help us live according to His will and find true happiness. They are expressions of His love for us, designed to protect us and guide us toward holiness. Following these laws helps us to grow in virtue and become the people God created us to be.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">In our modern world, it can be challenging to follow God's laws. We may face pressure from society to compromise our values or to ignore God's teachings. However, with God's grace, we can grow in submission to His laws and find the strength to live according to His will.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those preparing for baptism, let us ask God to help them understand the importance of following His laws. Let us pray that they will grow in submission to God's will and find joy in living according to His plan for their lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that submission to God's laws is not about losing our freedom, but about finding true freedom in living according to God's will. With His grace, we can all grow in this virtue and find the peace and joy that comes from following His laws.</p>
