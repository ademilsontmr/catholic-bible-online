            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for understanding for all who do not understand the significance of baptism. This day reminds us that many people in our world do not understand the importance of this sacrament and the role it plays in our salvation.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Baptism is not just a cultural tradition or a social ceremony, but a sacrament that is necessary for salvation. Through baptism, we are cleansed of original sin, become children of God, and are welcomed into the Church. It is the gateway to all other sacraments and the beginning of our life as Christians.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Many people in our fallen world do not understand this significance. They may see baptism as just a tradition or a cultural practice, without understanding its spiritual importance. They may not realize that baptism is necessary for salvation and that it brings about real spiritual effects.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we pray for those preparing for baptism, let us also pray for all who do not understand its significance. Let us ask God to grant them understanding and to help them see the importance of this sacrament.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that we all have a responsibility to help others understand the faith. Whether through our words, our actions, or our prayers, we can all help others come to understand the importance of baptism and the other sacraments. With God's grace, we can all be instruments of His love and help bring others to Him.</p>
