              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all who are considering being baptized. This final day of our novena reminds us that God wants each of us to be saved and to spend eternity with Him in heaven, but not all people respond to His grace.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">God is constantly calling people to Himself and offering them the grace to respond to His love. Many people feel this call in their hearts and are considering being baptized, but they may be hesitant or uncertain about taking this step. They need our prayers and God's grace to help them respond to His call.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Responding to God's grace is not always easy. It may require courage to take the step of being baptized, especially if family or friends do not understand or support this decision. It may require faith to trust in God's love and to believe that He will help us in our spiritual journey.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As we conclude this novena, let us pray for all who are considering being baptized. Let us ask God to help them respond to His grace and to give them the courage and faith they need to take this important step in their spiritual journey.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Remember that we all have a role to play in helping others respond to God's grace. Whether through our prayers, our example, or our words, we can all help others come to know God and respond to His love. With God's grace, we can all be instruments of His mercy and help bring others to Him.</p>
