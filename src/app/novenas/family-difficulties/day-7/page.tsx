              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families to grow in perseverance. When families face ongoing difficulties, it can be easy to become discouraged and want to give up. The daily grind of dealing with problems can wear down even the strongest families. James 1:12 reminds us that those who persevere under trial are blessed and will receive the crown of life. This promise encourages us to keep going even when things are difficult. Perseverance doesn't mean pretending that everything is fine or ignoring problems. It means continuing to work toward healing and growth even when progress is slow or setbacks occur. Families who persevere through difficulties often emerge stronger and more united. Let us pray that families facing ongoing challenges will find the strength to persevere and that they will see God\'s grace at work in their lives.</p>
