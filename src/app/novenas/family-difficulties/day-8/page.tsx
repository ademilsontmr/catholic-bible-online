            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families to grow in trust in God. When families are facing difficulties, it can be hard to trust that God has a plan or that He is working for their good. The pain and confusion of difficult circumstances can make God seem distant or uncaring. Proverbs 3:5-6 calls us to trust in the Lord with all our heart and not to lean on our own understanding. This means trusting God even when we don't understand what is happening or why. Trusting God doesn't mean that we won't feel pain or confusion, but it does mean that we believe God is with us and will help us through our difficulties. Families who learn to trust God in difficult times often find peace and strength that they didn't know they had. Let us pray that families facing trials will grow in their trust in God and that they will experience His faithfulness.</p>
