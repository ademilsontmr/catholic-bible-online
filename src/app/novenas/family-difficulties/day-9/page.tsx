              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for families to grow in the ability to offer their sufferings to God. When families face difficulties, their suffering can feel meaningless and overwhelming. However, when offered to God, this suffering can become a powerful means of grace and redemption.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Colossians 1:24 shows us that our sufferings can be united with Christ\'s sufferings for the good of the Church. Families can offer their pain for the conversion of sinners, for other families facing similar struggles, for the souls in purgatory, or for any other intention.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                This offering transforms their suffering from something that seems meaningless into something that has great spiritual value. It also helps families grow closer to Christ, who understands suffering and who can give meaning to our pain.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us pray that families facing difficulties will find the grace to offer their sufferings to God and that they will find meaning and purpose even in their pain.
