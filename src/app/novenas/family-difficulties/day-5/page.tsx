              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families struggling with trauma recovery. Trauma can affect families in many ways - through abuse, accidents, natural disasters, violence, or other traumatic events. The effects of trauma can be long-lasting and can impact every aspect of family life, from communication to trust to emotional intimacy. Psalm 34:18 reminds us that God is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. This promise offers hope to families dealing with trauma that God is near to them in their pain and will help them heal. Trauma recovery is often a long and difficult process that requires professional help, support from others, and lots of patience and love. Let us pray that families dealing with trauma will find the help they need and that they will experience God\'s healing presence in their lives.</p>
