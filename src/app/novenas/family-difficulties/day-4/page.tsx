              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families struggling with marital problems. When a marriage is troubled, it affects the entire family. Children are particularly sensitive to their parents' relationship and can suffer greatly when there is conflict, tension, or distance between their parents. Ephesians 5:25 calls husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church. This high standard of love requires sacrifice, patience, and forgiveness - qualities that can be difficult to maintain when a marriage is struggling. Marital problems can stem from many sources: communication issues, financial stress, infidelity, addiction, or simply growing apart over time. Let us pray that couples facing marital difficulties will find the grace to work through their problems, that they will seek help when needed, and that they will remember the love that brought them together.</p>
