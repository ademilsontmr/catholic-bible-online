              The Novena for Family Difficulties is a traditional nine-day prayer designed to help families 
              facing various challenges and struggles. This novena acknowledges that family life, while a great blessing, 
              can also bring difficulties that require God's grace and assistance.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The title "Family Difficulties" reminds us that even the most loving families can face trials 
              such as health problems, financial stress, marital issues, grief, trauma, and lack of support. 
              These difficulties can test our faith and strain our relationships, but they can also draw us closer to God.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This novena helps families to pray for various aspects of healing and strength - from physical 
              and emotional healing to spiritual growth and trust in God's plan, while always maintaining hope in God's love.
