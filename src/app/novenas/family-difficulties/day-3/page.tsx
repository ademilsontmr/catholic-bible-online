              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families struggling with financial difficulties. Money problems can create tremendous stress in family life, affecting relationships, health, and even faith. When families are worried about paying bills, providing for their children, or keeping their home, it can feel like God has abandoned them. Philippians 4:19 reminds us that God will meet all our needs according to His riches in glory. This promise doesn't mean we won't face financial challenges, but it does mean that God will provide what we truly need. Financial difficulties can also be an opportunity for families to grow closer to God and to each other as they learn to trust in His provision. Let us pray that families facing financial stress will find peace in God\'s promises and that they will be guided to the resources and support they need.</p>
