              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for families who lack support. When families are going through difficult times, they often need help from others - practical help like meals or childcare, emotional support like listening and encouragement, or spiritual support like prayer and guidance. Galatians 6:2 calls us to carry each other\'s burdens, fulfilling the law of Christ. This means that we are called to support families in need, and families in need should be able to find support from their community. Unfortunately, many families feel isolated and alone in their struggles. They may not have family nearby, their friends may not understand their situation, or they may be too embarrassed to ask for help. Let us pray that families who lack support will find the help they need and that we will be open to supporting families in our communities.</p>
