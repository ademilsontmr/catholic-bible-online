              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Most Loving and Peaceful Father, we come before You today with hearts that are weary from anxiety and minds that are troubled by fear. We acknowledge that You are the Prince of Peace, the One who calms every storm and brings tranquility to every troubled heart. You understand the depths of our anxiety because You have experienced human suffering through Your Son, Jesus Christ, who knows our struggles intimately.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that anxiety and fear can make us feel as if we are drowning in a sea of worry and uncertainty. These emotions can rob us of our peace, our joy, and our ability to trust in Your loving care. We know that these feelings are not from You, but from the enemy who wants to steal our peace and keep us in bondage to fear.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that true peace comes not from the absence of problems, but from the presence of Your love and the assurance of Your care. Help us to see that You are always with us, always watching over us, and always working for our good, even when we cannot see or understand what You are doing.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to trust in Your perfect peace, which surpasses all understanding. Give us the grace to believe that You are in control of every situation, that You have a plan for our lives, and that You will never leave us or forsake us. Help us to remember Your promise that You will keep us in perfect peace when our minds are stayed on You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to surrender all our anxiety to You, knowing that You care for us deeply and want to carry our burdens. Teach us to cast all our cares upon You because You care for us. Help us to understand that when we give our worries to You, we can experience the peace that only You can give.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling with anxiety and fear. May they too find peace and comfort in Your loving care. Help us to be instruments of Your peace to others, sharing the hope and tranquility that we find in trusting You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will answer our prayers according to Your perfect will and in Your perfect timing. Thank You for Your peace, Your love, and Your care. We place our complete trust in You, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
