              <p className="mb-4">Gracious and Protective Father, we come before You today seeking refuge and safety in Your infinite love and protection. We acknowledge that You are our refuge and our fortress, our God in whom we trust. You are the One who shelters us under Your wings and protects us from all harm and danger.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that when we are filled with anxiety and fear, we often feel exposed, vulnerable, and unsafe. We may feel as if there is no place to hide from our worries and no shelter from our fears. But we know that You are our safe haven, our place of refuge where we can find rest and security.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that finding refuge in Your love means running to You with all our fears and anxieties, knowing that You will welcome us with open arms and provide us with the safety and security we need. Help us to see that Your love is a fortress that cannot be shaken, a shelter that cannot be destroyed.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to find refuge in Your love by spending time in Your presence, reading Your Word, and meditating on Your promises. Give us the grace to believe that when we are in Your presence, we are safe from all harm and protected from all danger. Help us to understand that Your love is stronger than any fear and more powerful than any anxiety.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that finding refuge in Your love also means trusting in Your protection and believing that You will keep us safe from all evil. Help us to see that You are our shield and our defender, and that nothing can harm us when we are under Your care.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking refuge from anxiety and fear. May they too find safety and security in Your loving arms. Help us to be witnesses of Your protective love to others, sharing the peace and security that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will provide us with the refuge and protection we need. Thank You for Your love and Your care. We find our refuge in You, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
