                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Loving and Merciful Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to let go of worry and the need to control everything. We acknowledge that You are the God who is in control of all things, the One who holds the universe in Your hands and who knows exactly what we need and when we need it. You are the One who can handle all our problems and who wants to carry our burdens for us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that worry and the need to control everything are often the root causes of our anxiety and fear. We may worry about things we cannot control, try to control things that are beyond our power, or fear that if we don't control everything, something will go wrong. But we know that this way of thinking only leads to more anxiety and less peace.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that letting go of worry and control means trusting that You are in control and that You can handle all our problems better than we can. Help us to see that when we try to control everything, we are actually taking on burdens that You never intended for us to carry.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to let go of worry and control by giving us the grace to surrender our problems to You and trust that You will take care of them. Help us to understand that when we give our worries to You, we can experience a peace that we cannot find when we try to control everything ourselves.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that letting go of worry and control also means accepting that we cannot control everything and that we don't need to. Help us to see that when we accept our limitations and trust in Your unlimited power, we can experience freedom from anxiety and peace in our hearts.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to let go of worry and control. May they too find the grace to surrender their problems to You and trust in Your care. Help us to be witnesses of Your care and control to others, sharing the peace and freedom that we find in surrendering to You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will help us to let go of worry and control and find peace in surrendering to Your care. Thank You for Your love and Your promise to carry our burdens.</p>

                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
