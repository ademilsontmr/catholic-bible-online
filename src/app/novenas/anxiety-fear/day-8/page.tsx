                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Radiant and Truthful Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to walk in Your light and to trust in Your truth. We acknowledge that You are the God who is light and in whom there is no darkness at all, the One who is the way, the truth, and the life. You are the One who illuminates our path and guides us with Your truth.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that anxiety and fear often thrive in darkness and confusion. When we are walking in darkness, we cannot see clearly, we may stumble and fall, and we may feel lost and afraid. But when we walk in Your light, we can see clearly, we can walk confidently, and we can find peace and security.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that walking in Your light means allowing Your truth to guide our thoughts, our words, and our actions. Help us to see that when we walk in Your light, we can see the truth about ourselves, about others, and about our circumstances, and this truth can set us free from anxiety and fear.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to walk in Your light by giving us the grace to read and meditate on Your Word, which is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. Help us to understand that when we fill our minds with Your truth, we can find peace and freedom from the lies that anxiety and fear often tell us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that walking in Your light also means being honest with ourselves and with You about our fears and anxieties. Help us to see that when we bring our fears into the light of Your truth, they begin to lose their power over us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking to walk in Your light. May they too find guidance and truth in Your Word and Your presence. Help us to be witnesses of Your light and truth to others, sharing the peace and freedom that we find in walking with You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will help us to walk in Your light and trust in Your truth. Thank You for Your light and Your truth. We walk in Your light, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
