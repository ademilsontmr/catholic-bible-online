              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Triumphant and Liberating Father, we come before You today on this final day of our novena, seeking the grace to live in complete peace and freedom from anxiety and fear. We acknowledge that You are the God who gives us peace that surpasses all understanding, the One who sets us free from all bondage and who wants us to live in the freedom and joy of Your love.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that living in complete peace and freedom from anxiety and fear is not just about feeling good or being happy, but about experiencing the deep, abiding peace that comes from knowing that You are in control, that You love us, and that You are working all things together for our good. This peace is a gift that You give to those who trust in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that living in complete peace and freedom means choosing to trust in You every day, choosing to surrender our worries to You, and choosing to focus on Your love and Your promises rather than on our fears and anxieties. Help us to see that this is a daily choice that we must make, and that You will give us the grace to make this choice.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to live in complete peace and freedom by giving us the grace to remember Your promises, to trust in Your care, and to believe that You are always with us. Help us to understand that when we live in this peace and freedom, we can be witnesses of Your love and Your power to others.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that living in complete peace and freedom also means being grateful for Your love and Your care, and sharing this gratitude with others. Help us to see that when we live in gratitude, we can experience even more peace and freedom.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking to live in complete peace and freedom. May they too find the grace and strength they need through Your love and Your power. Help us to be witnesses of Your peace and freedom to others, sharing the joy and tranquility that we find in living with You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will help us to live in complete peace and freedom from anxiety and fear. Thank You for Your peace and Your freedom. We live in Your peace, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
