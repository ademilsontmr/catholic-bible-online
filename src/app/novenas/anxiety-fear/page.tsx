            <p className="mb-4">
              Anxiety and fear are natural human responses to perceived threats or uncertainty, but when they become overwhelming 
              or persistent, they can significantly impact our mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Anxiety can manifest 
              as constant worry, racing thoughts, physical symptoms, and a sense of impending doom.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic understanding of anxiety and fear recognizes that while these emotions are part of our human experience, 
              God wants us to find peace and freedom from their grip. Through prayer, trust in God's providence, and His grace, 
              we can overcome anxiety and fear and experience the peace that surpasses all understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novena helps you to bring your anxiety and fears to God, who is the Prince of Peace. He understands your struggles 
              and wants to help you find freedom from worry and fear, replacing them with His perfect peace and trust in His care.
