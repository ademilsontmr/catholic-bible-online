              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Almighty and Liberating Father, we come before You today seeking freedom from Fear's grip and the courage to face life with confidence and trust. We acknowledge that You are the God who sets captives free, the One who breaks every chain and opens every prison door. You have the power to liberate us from the bondage of fear and to give us the courage to live as free children of God.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that fear can have a powerful grip on our hearts and minds, making us feel trapped, paralyzed, and unable to move forward in life. Fear can prevent us from taking risks, pursuing our dreams, and living the life that You have planned for us. We know that this fear is not from You, but from the enemy who wants to keep us in bondage.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that breaking free from Fear's grip begins with recognizing that fear is not our master and that we do not have to be controlled by it. Help us to see that we have the power, through Your grace, to choose faith over fear and trust over worry.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to break free from Fear's grip by giving us the courage to face our fears head-on, knowing that You are with us and will give us the strength we need. Help us to understand that courage is not the absence of fear, but the decision to act in spite of fear, trusting in Your power and Your presence.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that breaking free from Fear's grip also means replacing our fears with faith, our worries with trust, and our anxiety with peace. Help us to see that when we focus on You and Your promises, our fears begin to lose their power over us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to break free from Fear's grip. May they too find the courage and strength they need through Your grace and love. Help us to be witnesses of Your liberating power to others, sharing the freedom and courage that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific anxiety and fear intentions here). We trust that You will break the grip of fear in our lives and give us the courage to live in freedom and confidence. Thank You for Your power and Your promise to set captives free.</p>
