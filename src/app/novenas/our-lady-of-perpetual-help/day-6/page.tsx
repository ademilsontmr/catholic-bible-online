                Today we pray for obedience to God's will, as Mary was perfectly obedient. 
                Obedience is a virtue that helps us to submit our will to God's will and to follow His commandments.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's obedience was perfect. When the angel Gabriel told her that she would be the Mother of God, 
                she responded with perfect obedience: "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word" (Luke 1:38).
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's obedience was not blind or forced, but was based on her love for God and her trust in His plan. 
                She knew that God's will was always for her good and for the good of others, even when it involved suffering.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us be obedient to God's will. 
                Let us ask her to help us submit our will to God's will and to follow His commandments with love and trust.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that obedience to God is not about losing our freedom, but about finding true freedom. 
                When we follow God's will, we find peace, joy, and fulfillment, because we are doing what we were created to do.
