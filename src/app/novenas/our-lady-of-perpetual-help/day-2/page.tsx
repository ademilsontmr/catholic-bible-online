                Today we pray for hope in Mary's maternal care and her ability to help us in difficulties. 
                Hope is a theological virtue that helps us to trust in God's promises and His plan for our salvation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary is our model of hope. Even when she stood at the foot of the cross, watching her Son suffer and die, 
                she never lost hope. She trusted in God's plan and knew that He would bring good out of this terrible situation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                The title "Perpetual Help" reminds us that Mary's help is constant and never-ending. 
                She is always available to us, always ready to intercede for us, and always ready to bring our prayers to Jesus.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to increase our hope in her. 
                Let us ask her to help us maintain hope even in difficult times, 
                knowing that she will always help us and bring our prayers to her Son.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that hope is not wishful thinking, but a confident expectation based on God's promises. 
                Mary helps us to hope because she knows that God is faithful and will never abandon us.
