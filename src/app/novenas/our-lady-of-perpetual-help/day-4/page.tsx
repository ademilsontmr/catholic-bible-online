                Today we pray for humility, following Mary's example of perfect humility before God. 
                Humility is the foundation of all other virtues and is essential for spiritual growth.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's humility was perfect. She recognized her nothingness before God and always gave Him all the glory. 
                When the angel Gabriel called her "full of grace," she responded with humility, calling herself "the handmaid of the Lord."
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's Magnificat shows her perfect humility: "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
                for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant" (Luke 1:46-48). She recognized that all her greatness came from God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us grow in humility. 
                Let us ask her to help us recognize our complete dependence on God and to serve others with humility.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. 
                It is recognizing that all our gifts and talents come from God and should be used for His glory and the service of others.
