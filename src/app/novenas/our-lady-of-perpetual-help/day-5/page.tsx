                Today we pray for purity of heart and mind, like the Immaculate Virgin Mary. 
                Purity is a virtue that helps us to keep our hearts and minds focused on God and His will.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary was conceived without original sin and remained pure throughout her life. 
                Her heart and mind were always focused on God, and she never allowed anything impure to enter her thoughts or actions.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's purity made her worthy to be the Mother of God. Her immaculate heart was a fitting dwelling place for the Son of God, 
                and her pure mind was always focused on doing God's will.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us grow in purity. 
                Let us ask her to help us keep our hearts and minds pure and focused on God.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that purity is not just about avoiding sin, but about actively choosing what is good and holy. 
                We should fill our minds with good thoughts, our hearts with good desires, and our actions with good deeds.
