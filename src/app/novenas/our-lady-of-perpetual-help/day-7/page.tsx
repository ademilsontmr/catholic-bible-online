                Today we pray for patience in suffering, following Mary's example at the foot of the cross. 
                Patience is a virtue that helps us to endure difficulties with trust in God's plan.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary's patience was perfect. When she stood at the foot of the cross, watching her Son suffer and die, 
                she could have given in to despair or anger. Instead, she endured this terrible suffering with patience and trust in God's plan.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary knew that God had a plan, even in this terrible suffering. She trusted that He would bring good out of this evil, 
                and she was patient in waiting for that good to be revealed. Her patience was not passive, but active - she continued to love and trust God.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask Mary to help us be patient in our sufferings. 
                Let us ask her to help us endure difficulties with patience and trust in God's plan.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Remember that patience is not about avoiding suffering, but about enduring it with trust in God. 
                When we are patient in suffering, we grow closer to God and become more like Him.
