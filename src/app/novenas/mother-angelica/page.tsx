              Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation (1923-2016) was an American Poor Clare nun and the foundress of 
              EWTN (Eternal Word Television Network). Despite a difficult childhood marked by family instability and poverty, 
              she persevered in faith and dedicated her life to serving God.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Mother Angelica entered the Poor Clare order and later felt called to use modern media to spread the Gospel. 
              She founded EWTN, which has become the largest Catholic media network in the world, reaching millions of people 
              with the message of Christ and the teachings of the Church.
