                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many freedoms we are blessed with in America. 
                We ask You to bless our country, and particularly to bring about good for our country through the Supreme Court.

                <strong>The Supreme Court has a great influence</strong> on many areas of our society in this country. 
                Rulings that do not reflect Your laws are greatly detrimental to each of us. 
                The conversion of all Supreme Court justices who do not wish to serve You can help bring about greater justice and holiness in our country.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Please bless and assist all members of the Supreme Court,</strong> and we particularly ask You today to grant the grace of conversion to all unreligious Supreme Court justices! 
                Help them to turn to You and to make decisions that align with Your divine law.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Help us to continually repent of our sins</strong> each day. 
                Help us to grow in holiness and virtue at every opportunity.

                Today we pray for the conversion of unreligious Supreme Court justices.
                Conversion is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to understanding His plan for society.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to convert hearts.
                As our Father, He knows exactly what we need and when we need it, especially when it comes to serving Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The focus on conversion for justices reminds us that no one is beyond God's mercy.
                God calls us to pray for the conversion of all justices so they may serve Him faithfully.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our prayers for conversion.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always convert hearts and open minds to His truth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's conversion is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to convert hearts, and we can trust completely in His divine mercy and love.
