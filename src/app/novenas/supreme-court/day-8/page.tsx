                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many freedoms we are blessed with in America. 
                We ask You to bless our country, and particularly to bring about good for our country through the Supreme Court.

                <strong>The members of the Supreme Court hold</strong> a great amount of power in our country. 
                Those who are virtuous should see this powerful position in the light of humility and should understand the great responsibility they hold to do what is good. 
                You can help the members of the Supreme Court to grow in the humility they need to serve You well.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Please bless and assist all members of the Supreme Court,</strong> and we particularly ask You today to grant the grace of humility to all of the Supreme Court justices! 
                Help them to understand their great responsibility and to serve You with humility.

                Today we pray for humility and responsibility in Supreme Court justices.
                Humility is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to understanding His plan for society.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to give us humility.
                As our Father, He knows exactly what we need and when we need it, especially when it comes to serving Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The focus on humility for justices reminds us that power should be exercised with humility.
                God calls us to pray for the justices to understand their great responsibility and to serve with humility.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our humility.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always guide us toward what serves Him with humility.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's gift of humility is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to give us humility, and we can trust completely in His divine guidance and love.
