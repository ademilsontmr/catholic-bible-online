                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many freedoms we are blessed with in America. 
                We ask You to bless our country, and particularly to bring about good for our country through the Supreme Court.

                in order to make decisions that are in line with what is truly good and just.

                <strong>Please bless and assist all members of the Supreme Court,</strong> and we particularly ask You today to grant the grace of charity to all of the Supreme Court justices! 
                Help them to make decisions with love for all people and with a desire to promote the common good.

                Today we pray for charity and love in Supreme Court justices. 
                Charity is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to understanding His plan for society.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to give us charity.
                As our Father, He knows exactly what we need and when we need it, especially when it comes to making just decisions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The focus on charity for justices reminds us that true justice must be motivated by love.
                God calls us to pray for the justices to make decisions with charity and concern for all people.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we complete this novena, let us ask God to increase our charity.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always guide us toward what is loving and just.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's charity is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to give us charity, and we can trust completely in His divine love and mercy.
