              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, help us live a devout life!</strong> Teach us how to integrate our spiritual
                practices with our daily responsibilities. May we learn to find God in all things and to serve Him
                through our work, relationships, and daily activities.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                St. Francis de Sales revolutionized spirituality by teaching that holiness is not reserved for religious
                or clergy alone. His famous book "Introduction to the Devout Life" was written specifically for lay people,
                showing them how to grow in holiness while living in the world.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                He taught that the devout life is not about escaping the world, but about transforming it through love.
                Every action, no matter how small, can be an act of love for God when done with the right intention.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we conclude this novena, let us ask St. Francis de Sales to help us live a truly devout life.
                Let us ask him to show us how to find God in all things and to serve Him through our daily activities.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that the devout life is not about perfection, but about progress. St. Francis de Sales shows us
                how to grow in holiness one day at a time, with gentleness and patience.
