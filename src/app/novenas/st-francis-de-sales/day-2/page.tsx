                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, patron of writers and journalists,</strong> you who used the written word
                so effectively to spread God's love and truth, you are always ready to help those who work with words
                to glorify God and serve others.

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, bless all writers and journalists!</strong> Help all Catholic writers
                and communicators to use their gifts for God's glory. May their words bring light to those in darkness,
                hope to the despairing, and truth to those who are searching.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                St. Francis de Sales is the patron saint of writers and journalists because of his prolific writing
                and his innovative use of the written word to spread the Gospel. His most famous work,
                "Introduction to the Devout Life," was written for ordinary lay people and became an instant success.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                When doors were slammed in his face during his missionary work, Francis found a creative solution:
                he wrote pamphlets explaining Catholic doctrine and slipped them under doors. This was one of the
                first recorded uses of religious tracts to communicate the faith to those who had fallen away from the Church.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask St. Francis de Sales to help all Catholic writers and communicators.
                Let us ask him to guide them in using their gifts to spread truth, beauty, and goodness in the world.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that words have power to influence and inspire. St. Francis de Sales shows us how to use
                the written word to bring people closer to God.
