                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, lover of God,</strong> you who taught that the love of God should be like romantic love,
                you are always ready to help us grow in our love for God and to develop a deeper relationship with Him.

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, increase our love for God!</strong> Help us to love God with the same intensity
                and devotion that you showed. May our thoughts be constantly turned toward God, our hearts filled with
                love for Him, and our lives a reflection of His love for us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                St. Francis de Sales compared the love of God to romantic love, saying that just as lovers think constantly
                of their beloved, speak of them, and long for them, so should we think of God, speak of Him, and long for Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                He taught that the key to loving God was prayer - turning our eyes to God in meditation so that our whole
                soul would be filled with Him. He believed that love of God was the foundation of all other virtues.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask St. Francis de Sales to help us grow in our love for God.
                Let us ask him to teach us how to develop a more intimate and loving relationship with our Creator.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that love of God is not just a feeling, but a choice and a commitment. St. Francis de Sales
                shows us how to cultivate this love through prayer, meditation, and daily acts of devotion.
