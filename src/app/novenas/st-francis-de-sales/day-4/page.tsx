            On this fourth day of the St. Francis de Sales Novena, we pray for holiness in daily life,

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, teacher of the universal call to holiness,</strong> you who taught
                that everyone is called to sanctity, regardless of their state in life, you are always ready
                to help us understand that holiness is possible for all.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Your wisdom showed that holiness is not reserved for religious alone.</strong>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O St. Francis de Sales, help us understand our call to holiness!</strong> Teach us that
                holiness is possible in our daily lives, in our families, in our work, and in all our relationships.
                May we strive for sanctity in everything we do, knowing that God calls each of us to be saints.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                St. Francis de Sales revolutionized the understanding of holiness by teaching that it is not
                reserved for religious or clergy alone. His famous book "Introduction to the Devout Life" was
                written specifically for lay people, showing them how to grow in holiness in their daily lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                He believed that every Christian, regardless of their vocation or state in life, is called to
                holiness. Whether married, single, working, or retired, everyone can and should strive for
                sanctity in their own circumstances.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask St. Francis de Sales to help us understand our own
                call to holiness. Let us ask him to show us how to grow in sanctity in our particular state in life.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that holiness is not about doing extraordinary things, but about doing ordinary things
                with extraordinary love. St. Francis de Sales shows us how to be holy in our everyday lives.
