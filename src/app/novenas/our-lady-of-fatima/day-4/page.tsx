                surrounded by thorns, showing us how much you suffer for the sins of the world. Your heart is pierced

                prayers and sacrifices for the conversion of sinners.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>O Mary, you are the perfect example of reparation,</strong> for you stood at the foot of the cross 
                and shared in Jesus' suffering for the salvation of souls. Help us to unite our sufferings with yours 
                and with Jesus' for the conversion of sinners and the salvation of souls.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for the grace to make reparation for sins and to console Mary's Immaculate Heart.
                Reparation is an act of love that helps to heal the wounds caused by sin.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                At Fatima, Mary showed us her Immaculate Heart surrounded by thorns, pierced by a sword. 
                This image represents the suffering that Mary endures because of the sins of the world. 
                Every sin, every act of ingratitude, every moment of indifference pierces her heart.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary asked the children at Fatima to make reparation for sins by offering prayers and sacrifices. 
                She told them that many souls go to hell because there is no one to pray and make sacrifices for them. 
                This shows us the importance of reparation in the spiritual life.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The three children responded to Mary's request with great generosity. They offered many sacrifices 
                and penances for the conversion of sinners. They understood that their small sacrifices could help 
                save souls and console Mary's heart.
              </p>

              <p>
                As we pray today, let us ask Mary to help us make reparation for our sins and for the sins of the world. 
                Let us offer our prayers, sacrifices, and sufferings for the conversion of sinners and to console 
                Mary's Immaculate Heart.
