                <strong>North American Martyrs,</strong> you suffered a lot on account of your Faith. Despite these many sufferings 
                and obstacles you faced, you continued to hold fast to your Faith and to work as missionaries.

                Some of you had the opportunity to save your lives and avoid sufferings by leaving behind your holy work. 
                But you persevered and chose to follow God's call, even to the point of death.
              </p>

                Today we pray for the virtue of perseverance shown by the North American Martyrs despite great dangers and difficulties. 
                Their ability to continue in their mission despite incredible suffering is a powerful example for us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs faced incredible sufferings on account of their Faith. They were tortured, imprisoned, 
                and faced the constant threat of death. Yet they continued to hold fast to their Faith and to work as missionaries, 
                never giving up on their mission.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Some of the martyrs had the opportunity to save their lives by abandoning their holy work, but they chose to persevere 
                and follow God's call, even to the point of death. This shows their incredible virtue of perseverance and their 
                commitment to doing what was right, no matter the cost.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same virtue of perseverance. 
                Let us ask them to help us choose to serve God no matter the cost and to always do what is right, 
                no matter how difficult it may be.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that perseverance is a virtue that we all need in our spiritual journey. The North American Martyrs show us 
                that following God requires courage, determination, and the willingness to persevere through difficulties. 
                May we follow their example and never give up on our faith.
