                Today we pray for the devotion to God shown by the North American Martyrs in serving His Church and ultimately giving up their lives for Him. 
                Their martyrdom is the ultimate expression of love and devotion to God.

                The North American Martyrs devoted their lives to serving God and His Church as missionaries to the Native American people. 
                Despite many hardships and sufferings, they continued to hold fast to their Faith and to their calling, never wavering in their commitment.

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we conclude this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same devotion to God and His Church. 
                Let us ask them to help us always be eager to devote our lives to God and His Church and to never allow sufferings 
                to cause us to waver in our Faith.

              <p>
                Remember that martyrdom is not just about dying for the Faith, but about living for it every day. The North American Martyrs show us 
                that true devotion to God means being willing to give everything for Him, including our very lives. May we follow their example 
                and devote our lives completely to God and His Church.
