                Their selfless service to others is a powerful example of Christian charity.

                The North American Martyrs faced many dangers and difficulties in their work as missionaries among the Native American people in North America. 
                Despite these challenges, they chose to faithfully continue their holy work out of love for God and for the people they served.

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same spirit of selfless service. 
                Let us ask them to help us choose to love God and neighbor even when it is very difficult and to persevere in virtue 
                even to the point of death if necessary.

              <p>
                Remember that true Christian love is selfless and sacrificial. The North American Martyrs show us that serving others, 
                especially those in need, is more important than our own safety or comfort. May we follow their example and serve others with love.
