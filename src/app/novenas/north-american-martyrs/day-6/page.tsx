                Today we pray for the virtue shown by the North American Martyrs in persevering in their Faith despite great persecution. 
                Their ability to remain faithful in the face of incredible suffering is a powerful example for us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs faced terrible persecution on account of their Faith and their holy work. Many of the Native 
                American people mistrusted them and persecuted them, yet they persevered in their Faith and continued their missionary work.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                They suffered terrible tortures and imprisonment because of their Faith and their work as missionaries. Despite these 
                incredible sufferings, they never wavered in their Faith and ultimately chose to give up their lives for God.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same strength of faith. 
                Let us ask them to help us never allow sufferings or persecution to deter us from serving God and to never waver 
                in our Faith, no matter what sufferings we might face.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that faith is a gift that must be nurtured and protected. The North American Martyrs show us that true faith 
                is stronger than any persecution or suffering. May we follow their example and remain faithful to God in all circumstances.
