                <strong>North American Martyrs,</strong> you were persecuted and tortured on account of your Faith and your holy work.

                Today we pray for the virtue shown by the North American Martyrs in courageously holding fast to their Faith to the point of death. 
                Their courage in the face of incredible suffering is a powerful example for us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs were persecuted and tortured on account of their Faith and their holy work. They suffered imprisonment, 
                the severing of their fingers, and other physical attacks because of their Faith. Despite these great sufferings, 
                they did not waver in their Faith or their commitment to God.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                They ultimately gave up their lives for God and His Church, showing the ultimate example of courageous faith. 
                Their courage was not born of human strength, but of their deep love for God and their trust in His promises.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same courageous faith. 
                Let us ask them to help us always practice our Faith courageously and to hold fast to our Faith even to the point 
                of death if necessary.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that courage is a gift from God that we can ask for and develop. The North American Martyrs show us that 
                true courage comes from faith and love for God. May we follow their example and practice our Faith courageously in all circumstances.
