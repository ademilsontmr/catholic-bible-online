                You devoted yourself to missionary work among hostile native peoples. Though you faced great dangers and sufferings,

                Today we pray for the grace to imitate the love of God shown by the North American Martyrs in choosing 
                to serve as Jesuits. Their decision to enter religious life was a profound act of love and trust in God.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs - St. Isaac Jogues, St. Jean de Brébeuf, St. Gabriel Lalemant, St. Antoine Daniel, 
                St. Charles Garnier, St. Noël Chabanel, St. René Goupil, and St. Jean de Lalande - all chose to serve God 
                as members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Their Jesuit vocation was not just a career choice, but a complete surrender to God's will. They understood 
                that religious life was a call to total dedication, to give everything to God and His service.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we begin this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us understand the beauty of vocation 
                and to inspire us to serve God wholeheartedly in whatever way He calls us.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that every Christian is called to holiness, whether in religious life, priesthood, or lay vocation. 
                The key is to serve God with the same wholehearted devotion that the martyrs showed.
