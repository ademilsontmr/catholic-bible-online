                <strong>North American Martyrs,</strong> you answered God's call to serve Him as missionaries in North America.

                Today we pray for the love of God shown by the North American Martyrs in their openness to God's will in their lives. 
                Their complete surrender to God's plan is a powerful example for all of us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs answered God's call to serve as missionaries in North America, even though this meant 
                leaving behind everything they knew and loved. They faced incredible obstacles and dangers, yet they never wavered 
                in their determination to serve God faithfully.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Some of the martyrs had the opportunity to abandon their work and save their lives, but they chose to continue 
                following God's call, even to the point of death. This shows their complete openness to God's will and their 
                willingness to accept whatever God asked of them.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same openness to God's will. 
                Let us ask them to help us be willing to follow God's call, whatever it may be, with the same faithfulness they showed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God has a plan for each of us. The North American Martyrs show us that following God's will 
                requires courage, trust, and complete surrender. May we follow their example and be open to serving God 
                in whatever ways He calls us.
