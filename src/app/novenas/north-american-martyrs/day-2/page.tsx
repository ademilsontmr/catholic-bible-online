                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for giving us the North American Martyrs as examples of holiness. 
                Help us to imitate the devotion to You they showed in their tireless work as missionaries in North America.

                <strong>North American Martyrs,</strong> you chose to serve God as missionaries in the distant lands of North America. 
                Though you faced many difficulties in this work, you persevered.
              </p>

                <strong>Please persevere in bringing my petitions before the throne of God!</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Your work as missionaries was not easy. Many of the Native American people were hostile to you and thought you meant to harm them. 
                You suffered a great deal as you worked to bring souls to God.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Pray for me,</strong> that I may never allow obstacles to deter me from serving God. 
                Pray that I may persevere in holiness, no matter what sufferings I might face.

                Today we pray for the devotion to God shown by the North American Martyrs in their tireless missionary work. 
                Their missionary zeal was fueled by their deep love for God and their desire to bring souls to Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The North American Martyrs left their comfortable lives in Europe to serve as missionaries in the harsh 
                and dangerous lands of North America. They faced extreme weather conditions, hostile native peoples, 
                and the constant threat of death, yet they persevered in their mission.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Their missionary work was not easy. Many of the Native American people were initially hostile and 
                misunderstood their intentions. The martyrs had to learn new languages, adapt to different cultures, 
                and face rejection and persecution.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask the North American Martyrs to help us develop the same missionary zeal 
                in our own lives. We may not be called to foreign missions, but we are all called to spread the Gospel 
                in our own way.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that missionary zeal is not just for priests and religious. Every Christian is called to be a 
                witness to Christ in their daily life, whether through words, actions, or example.
