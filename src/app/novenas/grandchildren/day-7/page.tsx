              <p className="mb-6">Just as pride can be the cause of many sins, the practice of true humility can help us grow in many virtues. Humility is not often prioritized in our modern world, but You know how very important it can be for our holiness. You can help our grandchildren to grow in the humility they need for holiness.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Please bless and assist our grandchildren in every circumstance, and we particularly ask today that You help our grandchildren grow in the virtue of humility.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all grandchildren to grow in the virtue of humility. This day reminds us that humility is the foundation of all other virtues and essential for spiritual growth.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Humility is not about thinking less of ourselves, but about thinking of ourselves less. It is the virtue that helps us recognize our dependence on God and our need for His grace. It also helps us treat others with respect and kindness, recognizing that we are all children of God.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">In our modern world, humility is often misunderstood or undervalued. Many people confuse it with weakness or low self-esteem. However, true humility is actually a sign of strength and wisdom, as it helps us see ourselves and others as God sees us.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As grandparents, we can help our grandchildren develop humility by teaching them to be grateful for their gifts, to acknowledge their mistakes, to ask for help when needed, and to treat everyone with respect. We can also model humility by admitting our own mistakes and asking for forgiveness.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Let us ask God to help our grandchildren grow in humility and to give us the grace to be examples of this virtue. May they learn to see themselves as God sees them and to treat others with love and respect.</p>
