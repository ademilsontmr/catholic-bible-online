              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for all grandchildren to grow in true intimacy with God. This day reminds us that God desires a personal, loving relationship with each of us, and we have the privilege of helping our grandchildren develop this relationship.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Intimacy with God is not about following rules or performing rituals, but about developing a deep, personal friendship with Him. It involves spending time with Him in prayer, listening to His voice, and allowing Him to transform our hearts and lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As grandparents, we can help our grandchildren grow in intimacy with God by encouraging them to pray regularly, teaching them to listen for God's voice in their hearts, and sharing our own experiences of God's love and guidance. We can also model this intimacy by making prayer a priority and by showing them how God works in our lives.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">When our grandchildren see us turning to God in good times and bad, trusting in His guidance, and finding peace in His presence, they learn that God is not distant or judgmental, but loving and personal.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Let us ask God to help our grandchildren develop a deep, intimate relationship with Him and to give us the wisdom to guide them in this journey. May they come to know and love God as their closest friend and greatest love.</p>
