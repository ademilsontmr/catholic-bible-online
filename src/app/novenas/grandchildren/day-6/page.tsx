                Today we pray for our grandchildren to grow in piety. As grandparents, we have a special role in helping our grandchildren develop the virtues they need for holiness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The Bible tells us that "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6). As we pray for our grandchildren, we can trust that God will help them grow in virtue and holiness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                God wants our grandchildren to grow in piety and all the virtues. When we pray for them and model these virtues in our own lives, we help them to understand what it means to live a holy life.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to give us the grace to be good examples for our grandchildren and to help them grow in all the virtues they need for holiness.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that our prayers and example can have a profound impact on our grandchildren's spiritual growth and their relationship with God.
