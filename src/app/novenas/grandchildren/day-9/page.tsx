              <p className="mb-4">A vocation is not just a career choice, but God's plan for how we can best serve Him and others. It might be to the priesthood, religious life, marriage, or single life. Whatever our vocation, it is a path to holiness and fulfillment.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">As grandparents, we can help our grandchildren discern their vocations by encouraging them to pray about their future, teaching them to listen for God's voice, and supporting them in their discernment process. We can also model faithfulness to our own vocations and show them that following God's call brings joy and peace.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">It's important to remember that God's call is not always easy to follow, and it may require sacrifice and courage. However, when we respond generously to His call, we find true happiness and fulfillment.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">Let us ask God to help our grandchildren discern their vocations and to give them the courage to respond generously to His call. May they find joy and fulfillment in serving God and others according to His plan for their lives.</p>
