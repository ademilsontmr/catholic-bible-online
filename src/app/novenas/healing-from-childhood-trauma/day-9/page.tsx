            On this final day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for the grace to offer our suffering to God for the good of souls. 
            You know well what it feels like to suffer, and You have given us the ability to unite our own sufferings to Yours. Today we ask God to help us offer our pain for the salvation of others.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your infinite mercy and love that never fails us. 
                We come before You today with hearts full of gratitude, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                You know well what it feels like to suffer, and You have given us the ability to unite our own sufferings to Yours. 
                We can offer all that we suffer, even such deep emotional suffering as the effects of childhood trauma, to You for the good of souls 
                and in reparation for sin. This transforms our pain into something meaningful and redemptive.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who are trying to recover from childhood trauma. Lord, You know the depth of their suffering 
                and the way it has affected their lives. We ask You to help them grow in the ability to offer all suffering to You and to find meaning 
                and purpose in their pain by uniting it to Your own suffering on the cross.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to make use of every means You give us for our holiness. Give us the grace to strive for sainthood each day, 
                even in the midst of our suffering. Teach us to offer our pain as a gift of love to You and for the salvation of souls.

          <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on offering our suffering to God, which is the final step in our journey of healing from childhood trauma. 
                This transforms our pain from something meaningless into something redemptive and meaningful.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Offering our suffering to God is the virtue that helps us find meaning and purpose in our pain. It's the quality that allows 
                us to unite our sufferings to Christ's own suffering on the cross, to offer our pain for the salvation of souls, and to find 
                redemption in the midst of our brokenness. In the context of healing from trauma, offering our suffering might mean praying 
                for others who are suffering, offering our pain for the conversion of sinners, or simply surrendering our pain to God's will.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that God never wastes our suffering. He can use even our deepest pain for His glory and 
                for the good of others. When we offer our suffering to Him, we participate in His redemptive work and find meaning in what 
                might otherwise seem meaningless.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might support someone who is struggling to find meaning in their suffering. Perhaps you can share 
                how offering your own pain to God has helped you, encourage them to pray for others, or simply remind them that their 
                suffering is not in vain. Remember that sometimes the greatest gift we can give someone is the reminder that their pain 
                can be transformed into something beautiful and redemptive.
