              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your constant presence and strength in our lives. 
                We come before You today with hearts full of hope, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Recovery from childhood trauma can be very difficult and often requires great perseverance. You instruct us 
                to come to You with all of our needs, and even when we feel very daunted or hopeless for true recovery 
                from childhood trauma, we should strive to persevere in seeking Your help.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who are trying to recover from childhood trauma. Lord, You know 
                the challenges they face, the setbacks they encounter, and the moments when they feel like giving up. 
                We ask You to pour out Your healing grace upon them, to give them the strength to persevere, and to help 
                them grow in perseverance throughout their recovery journey.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to do all we can to serve You worthily in our lives. Give us the grace to love You more and more 
                each day, even in the midst of our struggles. Teach us to persevere in prayer and in seeking Your help, 
                knowing that You are always ready to assist us.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on perseverance in recovery, which is essential for anyone on the journey of healing from childhood trauma. 
                Recovery is rarely a straight path - it often involves setbacks, challenges, and moments of doubt.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Perseverance is the virtue that helps us continue forward even when the journey is difficult. It's the quality 
                that keeps us going when we feel like giving up, when progress seems slow, or when we encounter obstacles 
                along the way.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that God is with us every step of the recovery journey. He doesn't expect 
                us to be perfect or to heal instantly. He asks only that we persevere, that we keep trying, and that we 
                continue to turn to Him for help.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might support someone who is struggling with perseverance in their recovery. 
                Perhaps you can offer encouragement, practical help, or simply your presence and prayers. Remember that 
                sometimes the greatest gift we can give someone is the reminder that they don't have to face their struggles alone.
