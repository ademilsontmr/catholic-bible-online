          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            On this sixth day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for humility to seek professional help and support in healing from trauma. 
            Sometimes our pride or fear can prevent us from reaching out for the help we need. Today we ask God to give us the humility to recognize when we need help and the courage to seek it.

              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your infinite wisdom and understanding of our human condition. 
                We come before You today with humble hearts, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dealing with the effects of childhood trauma can be very difficult and often requires professional help. 
                It is not always easy to seek the help we need from others, especially when we have learned to be self-reliant 
                or when we fear being judged or misunderstood.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who are struggling with the effects of childhood trauma. Lord, You know 
                the challenges they face in seeking help, the pride that can prevent them from reaching out, and the fear that 
                can paralyze them. We ask You to help them grow in the humility they need to seek help and to give them the 
                courage to reach out to professionals and support systems.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to do all we can to grow in virtue each day. Give us the grace to surrender our lives more fully to You 
                at every opportunity, including the opportunity to seek help when we need it. Teach us to be humble enough to 
                recognize our limitations and wise enough to seek the assistance we need.
              </p>

                <strong>Lord, hear our prayers and bring healing to all who suffer from childhood trauma!</strong>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on humility to seek help, which is essential for anyone on the journey of healing from childhood trauma. 
                Sometimes our pride or fear can prevent us from reaching out for the help we need.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Humility is the virtue that helps us recognize our limitations and our need for others. It's the quality that allows 
                us to admit when we can't handle something on our own and to reach out for assistance. In the context of healing 
                from trauma, humility might mean seeking professional counseling, joining a support group, or simply asking a friend 
                for help.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that seeking help is not a sign of weakness but a sign of wisdom. God has given 
                us the gift of community and the expertise of professionals to help us in our healing journey. He wants us to use 
                all the resources He has provided.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might support someone who is struggling to seek help. Perhaps you can offer encouragement, 
                share your own experiences, or simply be present and supportive. Remember that sometimes the greatest gift we can 
                give someone is the reminder that it's okay to ask for help.
