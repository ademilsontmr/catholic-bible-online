            On this eighth day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for trust in God's healing power and plan for our restoration. 
            It can be very difficult to trust God fully in the midst of suffering. Today we ask God to help us grow in trust and to believe in His perfect plan for our healing.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your infinite mercy and love that never fails us. 
                We come before You today with hearts full of hope, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                It can be very difficult to trust You fully in the midst of suffering. Struggling with the effects of childhood trauma 
                can be a great source of suffering, and all who are suffering in such a way are in great need of trust in You as they seek healing. 
                We know that You are always faithful and that Your love never fails.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who are trying to recover from childhood trauma. Lord, You know the doubts they may have, 
                the questions they may ask, and the struggle to believe that healing is possible. We ask You to help them grow in trust in God 
                and to believe in Your perfect plan for their restoration and healing.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to devote ourselves more fully to You each day. Give us the grace to seek deeper friendship with You at every opportunity. 
                Teach us to trust in Your timing, Your wisdom, and Your love, even when we cannot see the way forward.

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on trust in God, which is essential for anyone on the journey of healing from childhood trauma. 
                Trust is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to finding peace in the midst of suffering.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Trust in God is the virtue that helps us believe in His love, His wisdom, and His plan for our lives. It's the quality that allows 
                us to surrender our fears and doubts to Him, to believe that He is working for our good even when we cannot see it, and to find 
                peace in the midst of uncertainty. In the context of healing from trauma, trust might mean believing that healing is possible, 
                trusting in God's timing, or having faith that God will provide the help we need.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that God is always faithful. He never abandons us, never stops loving us, and never stops working 
                for our good. Even when we cannot see the way forward, He is leading us toward healing and wholeness. His love is constant and 
                His mercy is endless.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might support someone who is struggling with trust in God. Perhaps you can share your own experiences of 
                God's faithfulness, offer words of encouragement, or simply be present and supportive. Remember that sometimes the greatest gift 
                we can give someone is the reminder that God is trustworthy and that He never fails those who trust in Him.
