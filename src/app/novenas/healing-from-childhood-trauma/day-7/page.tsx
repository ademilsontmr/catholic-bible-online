            On this seventh day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for self-knowledge to understand the roots of emotional suffering and trauma. 
            Many people have difficulty understanding the reasons they are suffering emotionally. Today we ask God to help us understand ourselves better and to recognize the sources of our pain.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your infinite wisdom and understanding of our human condition. 
                We come before You today with hearts open to Your healing grace, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Many people have difficulty understanding the reasons they are suffering emotionally. When we experience trauma during childhood, 
                we are in great need of self-knowledge to understand the source of our suffering and to find healing. Without this understanding, 
                we may continue to suffer without knowing why or how to address the root causes.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who are trying to recover from childhood trauma. Lord, You know the confusion they feel, 
                the way they may blame themselves for their struggles, and the difficulty they have in understanding why they feel the way they do. 
                We ask You to help them grow in self-knowledge and to understand the roots of their emotional suffering.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to submit ourselves fully to You, even in the midst of suffering. Give us the grace to make our relationship with You 
                our top priority in life. Teach us to be gentle with ourselves as we seek to understand the sources of our pain and to trust 
                in Your guidance as we journey toward healing.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on self-knowledge, which is essential for anyone on the journey of healing from childhood trauma. 
                Understanding ourselves and the roots of our suffering is a crucial step toward healing.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Self-knowledge is the virtue that helps us understand our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's the quality that allows 
                us to recognize patterns in our lives, to understand why we react the way we do, and to identify the sources of our pain. 
                In the context of healing from trauma, self-knowledge might mean recognizing how past experiences affect our present reactions, 
                understanding our triggers, or identifying unhealthy coping mechanisms.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that self-knowledge is a gift from God. He wants us to understand ourselves so that we can 
                grow in holiness and find healing. This understanding should lead us closer to Him, not further away. It should help us to 
                be more compassionate with ourselves and others.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might support someone who is struggling with self-knowledge. Perhaps you can offer a listening ear, 
                share insights from your own journey, or simply be present and non-judgmental. Remember that sometimes the greatest gift 
                we can give someone is the space to explore their own thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment.
