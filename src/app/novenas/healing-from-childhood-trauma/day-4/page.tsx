            On this fourth day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for those who do not recognize that their suffering stems from childhood trauma. 
            Many people carry emotional wounds from their past without understanding the source of their pain. Today we ask God to grant them the grace of self-knowledge and the courage to face their past with His healing love.

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">

                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your infinite wisdom and understanding of our human condition. 
                We come before You today with humble hearts, asking for Your divine assistance for all who are struggling 
                with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                You do not want any of us to suffer, but You sometimes permit sin and suffering in our fallen world. 
                Many people undergo traumatic experiences during childhood, and we often endure suffering from that trauma 
                for many years. Some people do not even know that their suffering is from a childhood trauma, and this 
                lack of understanding can make healing even more difficult.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who do not know that their suffering is from past trauma. 
                Lord, You know the confusion they feel, the way they blame themselves for their struggles, and the 
                difficulty they have in understanding why they feel the way they do. We ask You to pour out Your 
                healing grace upon them, to grant them the gift of self-knowledge, and to help them understand 
                the roots of their suffering so they can begin the journey of healing.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to grow to the deeper knowledge of ourselves that is necessary for growth in holiness. 
                Give us the grace to truly surrender our whole lives to You, including our past wounds and present struggles. 
                Teach us to be gentle with ourselves and others as we seek to understand the sources of our pain.
              </p>

                <strong>Lord, hear our prayers and bring healing to all who suffer from childhood trauma!</strong>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on the recognition of trauma, which is often the first step on the path to healing. 
                Many people carry emotional wounds from their childhood without understanding why they feel the way they do, 
                why they struggle with certain relationships, or why they have difficulty trusting others.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The journey of healing begins with self-knowledge. When we can recognize that our current struggles 
                have roots in past experiences, we can begin to understand ourselves better and seek appropriate help. 
                This recognition is not about blaming others or dwelling on the past, but about understanding ourselves 
                so we can move forward with greater freedom and peace.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask God for the grace of self-knowledge. This is a gift that helps us 
                understand our strengths and weaknesses, our wounds and our gifts. With this understanding, we can 
                better cooperate with God's grace in our healing journey.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might help someone who is struggling but doesn't understand why. Perhaps you 
                can offer gentle guidance, suggest professional help, or simply be a listening ear. Remember that 
                sometimes the greatest gift we can give someone is the space to explore their own story with compassion and understanding.
