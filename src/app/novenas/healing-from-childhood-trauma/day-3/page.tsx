          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            On this third day of the Healing from Childhood Trauma Novena, we pray for those who have experienced trauma from neglect and abandonment during their childhood. 
            The absence of care, love, and attention can be just as damaging as active abuse. Today we ask God to heal the wounds of neglect and restore the sense of worth and belonging that every child deserves.

                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for Your unfailing love and care for each of us. 
                We come before You today with hearts open to Your healing grace, asking for Your divine assistance 
                for all who are struggling with the effects of childhood trauma.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                You want all people to be happy with You in heaven, but while we live in this fallen world in the midst of sin, 
                we must suffer in many ways. Both the sinful actions of others and the neglect of others can bring great suffering, 
                especially during our childhood when we are most vulnerable and in need of care and protection.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we particularly lift up to You all who have experienced trauma from neglect. Lord, You know the deep 
                wounds that come from being ignored, abandoned, or left without the care and attention that every child needs. 
                You know the feelings of worthlessness, the fear of being forgotten, and the struggle to believe that we matter. 
                We ask You to pour out Your healing grace upon them, to fill the emptiness with Your love, and to restore their 
                sense of dignity and worth.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Help us to grow in trust in You even when we are suffering. Give us the grace to use every opportunity 
                You bring us to grow in virtue, especially the virtue of love. Teach us to be instruments of Your care 
                for those who have been neglected, showing them through our actions that they are valued and loved.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we focus on healing from neglect, which can be one of the most insidious forms of childhood trauma. 
                Unlike abuse, which involves active harm, neglect involves the absence of care, love, and attention that 
                every child needs to thrive.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Neglect can take many forms - physical neglect (lack of food, clothing, shelter), emotional neglect 
                (lack of love, attention, validation), or spiritual neglect (lack of guidance in faith and values). 
                Each type leaves its own unique scars on the developing child.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us remember that God never neglects us. He is always present, always caring, 
                always loving. His love is constant and unconditional, unlike the love of humans which can be 
                inconsistent and conditional. In Him, we can find the perfect parent we may have never had.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Consider today how you might be an instrument of God's care for someone who has experienced neglect. 
                Perhaps you can offer your time, your attention, or simply your presence to someone who feels invisible 
                or forgotten. Remember that sometimes the greatest healing comes from being seen and valued by another person.
