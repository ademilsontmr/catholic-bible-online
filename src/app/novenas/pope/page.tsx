              <strong>The Pope</strong> is the Bishop of Rome and the visible head of the Catholic Church on earth. 
              This devotion honors him as the Vicar of Christ and successor to the Apostle Peter, 
              to whom Jesus entrusted the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Vicar of Christ</strong> - The Pope is called the Vicar of Christ, meaning he acts in the person 
              of Christ as the visible head of the Church. He has the authority to teach, govern, and sanctify 
              the faithful, and his teachings on faith and morals are infallible when proclaimed ex cathedra.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Successor of Peter</strong> - The Pope is the direct successor to Saint Peter, the first Pope, 
              to whom Jesus said: "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church" (Matthew 16:18). 
              This apostolic succession ensures the continuity of Christ's Church throughout the ages.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Servant of the Servants of God</strong> - The Pope serves the Church with humility and love, 
              following the example of Christ who came not to be served but to serve. He is the shepherd 
              who guides the flock of Christ with care and compassion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Feast Days</strong> - The Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29) celebrates the two great 
              apostles, and this novena is especially popular among those seeking to support the Pope's ministry, 
              pray for Church unity, and grow in fidelity to the Church's teachings.
