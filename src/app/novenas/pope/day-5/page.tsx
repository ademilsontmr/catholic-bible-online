              The Pope is entrusted with the care of over a billion Catholics worldwide. He must govern with fidelity to Christ's teachings and with concern for the spiritual welfare of each soul entrusted to him.

              As we reflect on this aspect of the Pope's ministry and our duty to pray for him, let us ask ourselves how we can 
              better support the Holy Father through our prayers, fidelity to Church teaching, and love for the universal Church.
            </p>
            <p>
              May the Lord continue to bless and protect the Pope, and may we always remain united with him in prayer and fidelity.
