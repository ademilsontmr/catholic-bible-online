              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Gracious and Loving Father, we come before You today seeking to find inner strength and courage through Your infinite love and care. We acknowledge that You are the God who gives strength to the weary and power to the weak, the One who renews our strength like the eagle's and helps us to run without growing weary. You are the source of all true strength and the foundation of all courage.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that in our daily lives, we often feel weak, overwhelmed, and lacking in strength. We may face challenges that seem insurmountable, responsibilities that feel too heavy to bear, or circumstances that drain our energy and leave us feeling powerless. But we know that Your love is the source of true strength and that in You, we can find the courage to face any challenge.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find strength in Your love by reminding us that Your love is constant, unchanging, and always available to us. Help us to see that Your love is not conditional on our performance or circumstances, but is freely given to all who turn to You. Give us the grace to believe that Your love is strong enough to carry us through any difficulty.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to find strength in Your love by giving us the faith to believe that when we are weak, You are strong. Help us to understand that Your strength is made perfect in our weakness, and that when we rely on You, we can accomplish things that would be impossible on our own. Give us the courage to trust in Your strength rather than our own.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find strength in Your love by helping us to remember that You have overcome the world and that nothing is impossible for You. Help us to see that through Your love, we can find the strength to overcome any obstacle, face any challenge, and persevere through any difficulty. Give us the hope to believe that with You, all things are possible.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking strength in Your love. May they too find the courage and power they need through Your grace and Your care. Help us to be witnesses of Your strengthening love to others, sharing the power and hope that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific healing and strength intentions here). We trust that You will help us to find strength in Your love and face all challenges with courage. Thank You for Your love and Your strength. We find our strength in You, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
