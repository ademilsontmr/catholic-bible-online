              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Triumphant and Powerful Father, we come before You today on this final day of our novena, seeking the grace to live in complete healing and strength through Your power. We acknowledge that You are the God who gives us victory over all our enemies, the One who can make us strong when we are weak and give us the power to overcome any challenge. You are the God who calls us to live in the fullness of Your healing and strength.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that true healing and strength involve not just temporary relief or partial improvement, but complete transformation and renewal. This means living in the fullness of Your healing power and drawing on Your strength for every aspect of our lives. We know that this kind of complete healing and strength can only come through Your grace and power.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to live in complete healing and strength by giving us the grace to believe that You can heal us completely and give us the strength we need for every challenge. Help us to understand that living in Your healing and strength means trusting in Your power rather than our own, and relying on Your grace rather than our abilities. Give us the faith to believe that You can do what seems impossible.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to live in complete healing and strength by giving us the courage to step out in faith and to live as if we are already healed and strong. Help us to understand that faith often requires us to act as if we have already received what we are praying for, and that this kind of faith can help to bring about the healing and strength we need. Give us the boldness to live in the confidence of Your promises.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to live in complete healing and strength by helping us to focus on Your power and Your promises rather than on our limitations and weaknesses. Help us to understand that when we focus on Your strength rather than our weakness, on Your power rather than our limitations, we can experience the healing and strength that You want to give us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking to live in complete healing and strength. May they too find the grace and power they need through Your love and Your strength. Help us to be witnesses of Your healing and strengthening power to others, sharing the victory and confidence that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific healing and strength intentions here). We trust that You will help us to live in complete healing and strength through Your power. Thank You for Your healing power and Your strength. We live in Your power, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
