              <p className="mb-4">Wise and Purposeful Father, we come before You today seeking to find meaning and purpose in our struggles and challenges. We acknowledge that You are the God who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkness, and purpose out of pain. You are the One who can use our struggles to transform us and to help others who are going through similar difficulties.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that one of the most difficult questions we face when dealing with illness, weakness, or other challenges is "Why?" We may wonder why we are suffering, what purpose there could possibly be in our pain, and how we can find meaning in our struggles. But we know that You can bring meaning and purpose even out of the most difficult experiences.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find purpose in our struggles by helping us to see that our difficulties can make us more compassionate and understanding toward others who are suffering. Help us to understand that through our own experience of pain and weakness, we can become better able to comfort and support others who are going through similar challenges. Give us the grace to see our struggles as opportunities to grow in love and compassion.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to find purpose in our struggles by helping us to grow in faith and trust in You. Help us to understand that through our difficulties, we can learn to rely more deeply on You and to trust in Your love and Your plan for our lives. Give us the wisdom to see that our struggles can draw us closer to You and help us to become more like Christ.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find purpose in our struggles by helping us to see that our challenges can inspire us to live more fully and to appreciate the precious gift of life and health. Help us to understand that through our experience of weakness, we can learn to cherish our strength, to live with greater purpose, and to make a positive difference in the world.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking meaning and purpose in their struggles. May they too find the wisdom and understanding they need through Your grace and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your transforming power to others, sharing the meaning and purpose that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific healing and strength intentions here). We trust that You will help us to find meaning and purpose in our struggles. Thank You for Your wisdom and Your ability to bring good out of all things.</p>
