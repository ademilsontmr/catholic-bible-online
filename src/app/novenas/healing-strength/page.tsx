            <p className="mb-4">
              Healing and strength are gifts that God wants to give to all His children. Healing involves the restoration 
              of wholeness - physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental - while strength refers to the inner power and 
              resilience that comes from God's grace and love.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic understanding of healing and strength recognizes that we are created in God's image and that 
              He desires us to be whole and strong. Through prayer, the sacraments, and God's grace, we can experience 
              healing from all types of wounds and find the strength to face any challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novena helps you to bring all your needs for healing and strength to God, who is the Divine Physician 
              and the source of all power. He knows your struggles intimately and wants to heal you completely and give 
              you the strength you need to live a full and abundant life.
