              <p className="mb-4">Almighty and Wise Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to trust in Your perfect plan and Your timing for our healing and strength. We acknowledge that You are the God who works all things together for good for those who love You, the One who has a perfect plan for each of our lives and who knows exactly what we need and when we need it. You are the God who makes all things beautiful in their time.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that one of the most difficult aspects of seeking healing and strength is learning to trust in Your timing and Your plan. We may want immediate healing, instant strength, or quick solutions to our problems, but we know that Your plan is perfect and Your timing is always right. Your ways are higher than our ways, and Your thoughts are higher than our thoughts.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to trust in Your perfect plan by reminding us that You are in control of all things and that nothing happens outside of Your will. Help us to see that Your plan for our healing and strength is not limited by our understanding or our preferences, but is perfect and complete. Give us the grace to believe that You are working all things together for our good.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to trust in Your perfect plan by giving us the faith to believe that our current struggles and challenges are part of Your greater plan for our lives. Help us to understand that through our difficulties, we can grow in faith, character, and strength, and that these experiences can prepare us for the blessings You have planned for us. Give us the patience to wait for Your perfect timing.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to trust in Your perfect plan by helping us to see that Your plan often involves growth and transformation, not just immediate relief. Help us to understand that the healing and strength You want to give us may come through a process of growth and learning, and that this process is part of Your perfect plan for our lives.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to trust in Your plan. May they too find the faith and patience they need to believe in Your goodness and Your timing. Help us to be witnesses of Your faithfulness to others, sharing the trust and confidence that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific healing and strength intentions here). We trust that You will help us to trust in Your perfect plan and find peace in Your timing. Thank You for Your plan and Your wisdom. We trust in Your plan, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
