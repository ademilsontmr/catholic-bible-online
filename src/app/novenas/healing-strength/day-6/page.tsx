              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Loving and Liberating Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to let go of weakness and doubt, embracing Your strength and power instead. We acknowledge that You are the God who gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless, the One who can make us strong when we are weak and give us courage when we are afraid. You are the God who calls us to let go of our limitations and to embrace Your unlimited power.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that weakness and doubt can be major obstacles to receiving Your healing and strength. We may doubt Your power to heal us, doubt our worthiness to receive Your grace, or doubt that we can ever be strong enough to face our challenges. But we know that these doubts and weaknesses are not from You, but from the enemy who wants to keep us in bondage.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to let go of weakness and doubt by giving us the wisdom to recognize these obstacles for what they are. Help us to see that weakness and doubt are not permanent conditions, but temporary states that can be overcome through Your grace. Give us the courage to identify and confront these obstacles in our lives.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to let go of weakness and doubt by giving us the faith to believe in Your power and Your love. Help us to understand that when we are weak, You are strong, and that Your power is made perfect in our weakness. Give us the grace to believe that You can do what seems impossible and that You want to give us the strength we need.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to let go of weakness and doubt by helping us to focus on Your promises and Your faithfulness instead. Help us to see that when we focus on Your strength rather than our weakness, on Your power rather than our limitations, we can find the courage and confidence we need to move forward.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to let go of weakness and doubt. May they too find the courage and strength they need through Your grace and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your liberating power to others, sharing the freedom and confidence that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific healing and strength intentions here). We trust that You will help us to let go of weakness and doubt and embrace Your strength and power. Thank You for Your strength and Your power.</p>
