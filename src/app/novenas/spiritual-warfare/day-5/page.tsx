                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.

                You sometimes allow people to suffer from demonic possession. This can be frightening and hard for us to understand, 
                and it can be difficult to deal with. All who are fighting against demonic possession in themselves or others 
                are in great need of Your help.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help 
                all who are battling against demonic possession!
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to trust in You, even when we do not understand Your plan. Help us to submit ourselves to You more fully each day.

                Today we pray for deliverance from demonic possession and oppression. Demonic possession is a serious spiritual condition 
                that requires the intervention of the Church through the ministry of exorcism.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                While demonic possession is rare, demonic oppression and influence are more common. The devil can influence our thoughts, 
                emotions, and actions in subtle ways. We must be vigilant and recognize when we are under spiritual attack.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Deliverance comes through prayer, the sacraments, and the power of Jesus Christ. We must trust in God's plan, 
                even when we don't understand why He allows certain things to happen. We must also submit ourselves more fully to His will.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us trust in Him completely and to submit ourselves to His will. Let us also pray for all those 
                who are suffering from demonic possession or oppression.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that Jesus has power over all demons, and He can deliver us from any spiritual bondage when we turn to Him in faith.
