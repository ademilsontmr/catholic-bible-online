                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.

              <p className="mb-6">
                You have blessed us with holy priests who have authority over demons. In Your Church, you have provided for us 
                by giving us priests with the specific authority to exorcise demons when needed. You can help all exorcists 
                to be effective in their holy work.

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help 
                all exorcists as they fight against the devil!

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for exorcists and their holy work against evil. Exorcism is a sacred ministry of the Church 
                that requires special training, authorization, and a deep spiritual life.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Exorcists are priests who have been given the authority by the Church to perform exorcisms. They are on the front lines 
                of spiritual warfare, directly confronting demonic forces. Their work is dangerous and requires great courage, faith, and holiness.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                We should pray for exorcists regularly, asking God to protect them, strengthen them, and give them the wisdom 
                and courage they need to perform their ministry effectively. We should also pray for those who are suffering 
                from demonic possession and need the ministry of exorcism.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us also ask God to help us fight valiantly against all forms of evil in the world and to never become discouraged 
                in the battle against evil.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that we all have a role to play in spiritual warfare, even if we are not exorcists. 
                We can pray, fast, and live holy lives to help combat evil in the world.
