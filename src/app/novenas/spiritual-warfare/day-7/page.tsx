                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.

                You have given us a great gift in giving us Your Blessed Mother as our own, and she is very powerful against the devil. 
                All who are fighting battles of spiritual warfare should turn to Mary continually to make use of her powerful help.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help us grow

              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to always make use of all You have given us to fight against evil. Help us to do all we can to persevere

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for devotion to Mary and her powerful help against evil. The Blessed Virgin Mary is the most powerful 
                intercessor against the devil. She is the one who crushes the head of the serpent (Genesis 3:15).
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Mary is our mother, given to us by Jesus from the cross when He said to John, "Behold your mother" (John 19:27). 
                As our mother, she loves us with a perfect maternal love and is always ready to help us in our spiritual battles.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The devil is terrified of Mary because she is the one who brought Jesus into the world and who continues to bring 
                His grace to us through her intercession. When we turn to Mary in prayer, we are accessing one of the most powerful 
                weapons in spiritual warfare.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us grow in devotion to Mary and to rely on her help in all our spiritual battles. 
                Let us also ask Him to help us make use of all the spiritual weapons He has given us.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that Mary is always ready to help us, and her intercession is particularly powerful against the devil. 
                We should turn to her daily in prayer, especially the Rosary.
