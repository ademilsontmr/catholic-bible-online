            On this eighth day of the Spiritual Warfare Novena, we pray for humility as a weapon against the devil.

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We know that Satan seeks to destroy all who are in Your friendship, but he is particularly fearful of those who are truly humble. 
                As we grow in humility and increase our imitation of You, the hold of the devil on us can become weaker and weaker.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help us grow in the virtue of humility!
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to advance in all virtues necessary for holiness in our lives. Help us to seek greater imitation of You each day.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for humility as a weapon against the devil. Humility is one of the most powerful weapons in spiritual warfare 
                because the devil cannot stand it. He is the opposite of humility - he is pride personified.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                When we are truly humble, we recognize our complete dependence on God. We acknowledge that we are nothing without Him 
                and that all our good comes from Him. This attitude makes it very difficult for the devil to influence us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Jesus is our perfect example of humility. He, who is God, became man and humbled Himself even to death on the cross. 
                He teaches us that true greatness comes from serving others and putting God first in everything.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us grow in humility and to advance in all the virtues necessary for holiness. 
                Let us also ask Him to help us seek greater imitation of Jesus each day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that humility is not thinking less of ourselves, but thinking of ourselves less. 
                It is focusing on God and others rather than on ourselves.
