                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.

                Some people choose to turn away from You by participating in occult activities, but You are always ready 
                to welcome those who repent from this sin. Those who have repented of past involvement in the occult 
                are in great need of Your help as they attempt to leave their past relationship with the demonic behind.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help 
                all who have repented of past involvement in occult activity!

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for repentance from occult activities and past sins. Repentance is a crucial weapon in spiritual warfare. 
                When we repent, we turn away from evil and return to God's love and mercy.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Occult activities open doors to demonic influence and can have long-lasting spiritual consequences. 
                However, God's mercy is infinite, and He is always ready to welcome back those who repent and turn away from evil.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                True repentance involves not only sorrow for our sins but also a firm resolution to avoid them in the future. 
                It requires us to break all ties with evil and to seek God's forgiveness through the sacrament of Confession.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us truly repent of our sins and to grow in love for Him each day. 
                Let us also pray for all those who are trying to break free from occult involvement.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God's mercy is greater than any sin, and He will always welcome us back when we repent with a contrite heart.
