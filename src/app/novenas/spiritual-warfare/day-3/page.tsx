                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.

                Though we do not always understand why, You sometimes allow demons to afflict people in extraordinary ways.

                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help

              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for trust in God during extraordinary demonic activity. Sometimes God allows us to experience 
                visible demonic activity to strengthen our faith and trust in Him. These experiences can be frightening, 
                but they are also opportunities to grow closer to God.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                When we face extraordinary demonic activity, we must remember that God is in control. He allows these things 
                to happen for a reason, and He will provide us with the grace and strength we need to overcome them.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Trust is essential in spiritual warfare. We must trust that God loves us and wants what is best for us. 
                We must trust that He will never abandon us, even in our darkest moments. We must trust that He has the power 
                to deliver us from any evil.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us grow in trust, especially when we face frightening spiritual battles. 
                Let us also pray for all those who are experiencing extraordinary demonic activity in their homes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God is always with us, and He will never allow us to be tested beyond what we can bear. 
                With His grace, we can overcome any spiritual battle.
