                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                It can be difficult to understand why You allow Satan to attack at times, but we should strive to submit ourselves 
                to You even when we do not understand why we are suffering. True submission to Your will helps us in many ways, 
                especially as we engage in spiritual warfare.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help us grow in submission to Your will!

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to strive to grow closer to You even when we are suffering. Help us to always offer all of our sufferings in union with Yours.

                Today we pray for submission to God's will in all circumstances. Submission to God's will is the ultimate weapon 
                in spiritual warfare because it aligns us completely with God's plan for our lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                It can be difficult to understand why God allows us to suffer or why He allows the devil to attack us at times. 
                However, we must trust that God has a plan and that everything He allows is for our ultimate good.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                True submission to God's will means accepting His plan for our lives, even when we don't understand it. 
                It means offering our sufferings in union with the sufferings of Jesus on the cross. It means trusting that 
                God will bring good out of even the most difficult situations.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us grow in submission to His will and to strive to grow closer to Him even when we are suffering. 
                Let us also ask Him to help us offer all our sufferings in union with His.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God never abandons us, even in our darkest moments. He is always with us, and He will bring us 
                through every trial if we trust in Him and submit to His will.
