                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Many who have been enmeshed in patterns of recurrent sin are in great need of assistance as they battle 
                against the devil in their lives. You can provide holy friends to be of great help to those who are fighting 
                against the ordinary work of the devil in their lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help 
                all who are assisting those fighting against recurrent sin and temptation in their lives!
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to always be eager to assist our brothers and sisters in Christ in any way we can. 
                Help us to love others out of love for You.

                Today we pray for holy friends and support in our spiritual battles. In spiritual warfare, we are not meant 
                to fight alone. God has given us the gift of community and friendship to help us in our struggles.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Holy friends can provide us with encouragement, accountability, and prayer support. They can help us recognize 
                when we are being tempted and remind us of God's love and mercy. They can also help us stay on the right path 
                when we are struggling with sin.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                We should also be willing to be that support for others. When we see our brothers and sisters in Christ 
                struggling, we should reach out to them with love and compassion. We should offer our prayers and our friendship 
                to help them in their spiritual battles.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us ask God to help us find holy friends who can support us in our spiritual journey, and let us also 
                ask Him to help us be that support for others who are struggling.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that we are all part of the Body of Christ, and we are called to support one another in love. 
                Together, we are stronger than we are alone.
