                <strong>Dear Lord,</strong> we thank You for the many helps You give us for our salvation. 
                We ask You to continue to assist us and defend us in the battle against the devil as he seeks to destroy us.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                You know that there are many ways Satan tries to harm us. When he tries to hurt us through the ordinary means 
                of temptation to sin, we often do not realize he is at work. We are in great need of Your grace to fight 
                against the temptations of the devil in our lives.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We ask You to assist us in all battles of spiritual warfare, and we particularly ask You today to help 
                all who are fighting against temptation and sin in their lives!
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Help us to rely on You for all that we need in our lives. Help us to persevere in the fight against sin through Your grace.

          <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8">
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today we pray for strength against temptation and sin in our daily lives. Temptation is one of the most common 
                forms of spiritual warfare that we face. The devil often works in subtle ways, making us think that our temptations 
                are just normal human weaknesses.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                However, we must remember that every temptation is an attack from the enemy. The devil knows our weaknesses 
                and uses them against us. He wants to separate us from God and lead us into sin.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                But we have powerful weapons against temptation: prayer, the sacraments, and God's grace. When we are tempted, 
                we should immediately turn to God and ask for His help. We should also remember that Jesus Himself was tempted 
                in the desert, and He understands our struggles.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we begin this novena, let us ask God to help us recognize the devil's tactics and to give us the strength 
                to resist his temptations. Let us also pray for all those who are struggling with temptation and sin.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that God never allows us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. With His grace, we can overcome 
                any temptation and grow stronger in our spiritual life.
