                Today we pray for the conversion of all who are hostile to Christianity and to do all we can to bring others to conversion. 
                We remember how Pope Pius V called on all to pray the Rosary for Mary's help.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The hostility of the Ottoman Empire was a great threat to Christianity. They were actively working against the Christian faith 
                and seeking to destroy it. Pope Pius V recognized the seriousness of this threat and called on all Christians 
                to pray the Rosary for Mary's help during the Battle of Lepanto.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                This teaches us that we should pray for the conversion of those who are hostile to Christianity. 
                Instead of responding with hatred or violence, we should pray for their conversion and do all we can 
                to bring others to the faith through our words and example.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we pray today, let us ask Mary to pray for the conversion of all who are hostile to Christianity. 
                Let us ask her to help us do all we can to bring others to conversion and to eagerly share the faith with others at every opportunity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember that we are called to be witnesses of the Gospel and to share our faith with others. 
                When we share the faith with love and charity, we are helping others to come to know Jesus Christ. 
                Let us always be ready to share our faith and to pray for the conversion of those who are hostile to Christianity.
