                Most holy and afflicted Virgin, Queen of Martyrs, you stood beneath the cross, witnessing the agony of your dying Son. Look with a mother's tenderness and pity on us, as we kneel before you. We venerate your sorrows, and place our request with dutiful confidence in the sanctuary of your wounded heart.

                Present them, we beseech you, on our behalf to Jesus Christ, through the merits of His own most Sacred Passion and Death, together with your sufferings at the foot of the cross. Through the united efficacy of both, obtain the granting of our petition.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Holy Mary, your soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow at the sight of the passion of your divine Son. Intercede for us and obtain from Jesus these petitions if they be for His honor and glory and for our good and the good of our nation.
