              <strong>Our Lady of Sorrows</strong> is a title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in honor of her 
              seven sorrows, particularly her standing at the foot of the cross during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. 
              She is venerated as the "Queen of Martyrs" and is known for her deep understanding of human suffering.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Queen of Martyrs</strong> - Our Lady of Sorrows is honored as the Queen of Martyrs because 
              she suffered more than any other martyr, witnessing the agony and death of her divine Son. Her soul 
              was pierced by a sword of sorrow, as prophesied by Simeon.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Mother of Mercy</strong> - Our Lady of Sorrows is known as the Mother of Mercy because she 
              has drunk so deeply of the chalice of her Son's suffering that she can with compassion receive our sorrows 
              and intercede for us with understanding and love.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Sanctuary of Wounded Heart</strong> - Her wounded heart is a sanctuary where we can place our 
              requests with confidence. She understands our sufferings and will present our petitions to Jesus through 
              the merits of His Passion and Death.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Feast Day</strong> - The Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows is celebrated on September 15th, and this 
              novena is especially popular among those seeking her intercession for peace, protection, and the end of 
              abortion, as she understands the pain of losing innocent life.
