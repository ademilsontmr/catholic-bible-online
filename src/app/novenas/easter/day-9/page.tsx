O Risen Lord Jesus Christ, we praise You and we glorify You. You have conquered death and opened the gates of heaven for us. You have given us the promise of eternal life and the hope of resurrection.

Lord Jesus, as we complete this Easter Novena, we thank You for Your great love that led You to die on the cross for our sins. We rejoice in Your glorious Resurrection that gives us hope and joy.

We ask You to bless us abundantly and to guide us in our daily lives. Help us to be witnesses of Your Resurrection to others, sharing the Good News of Your love and salvation.

O Risen Christ, we place all our hopes and dreams in Your hands. We trust in Your promise that You will be with us always, even to the end of the age.

Alleluia! Christ is risen! He is truly risen! Alleluia!

Amen.
