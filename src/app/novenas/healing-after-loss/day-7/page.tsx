              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Wise and Purposeful Father, we come before You today seeking to find meaning and purpose in our suffering and loss. We acknowledge that You are the God who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkness, and purpose out of pain. You are the One who can use our suffering to transform us and to help others who are suffering.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that one of the most difficult questions we face after experiencing loss is "Why?" We may wonder why this happened, what purpose there could possibly be in our pain, and how we can find meaning in our suffering. But we know that You can bring meaning and purpose even out of the most difficult experiences.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find purpose in our pain by helping us to see that our suffering can make us more compassionate and understanding toward others who are suffering. Help us to understand that through our own experience of loss and grief, we can become better able to comfort and support others who are going through similar experiences. Give us the grace to see our pain as an opportunity to grow in love and compassion.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to find purpose in our pain by helping us to grow in faith and trust in You. Help us to understand that through our suffering, we can learn to rely more deeply on You and to trust in Your love and Your plan for our lives. Give us the wisdom to see that our pain can draw us closer to You and help us to become more like Christ.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find purpose in our pain by helping us to see that our loss can inspire us to live more fully and to appreciate the precious gift of life. Help us to understand that through our experience of loss, we can learn to cherish our relationships, to live with greater purpose, and to make a positive difference in the world.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking meaning and purpose in their suffering. May they too find the wisdom and understanding they need through Your grace and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your transforming power to others, sharing the meaning and purpose that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to find meaning and purpose in our pain. Thank You for Your wisdom and Your ability to bring good out of all things.</p>
