              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Loving and Liberating Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to let go of what we cannot change and to move forward with faith and hope. We acknowledge that You are the God who makes all things new, the One who can bring new life out of death and hope out of despair. You are the God who calls us to let go of the past and to embrace the future with courage and trust.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that one of the most difficult aspects of healing after loss is learning to let go of what we cannot change and to move forward with our lives. We may hold onto the past, wishing things could be different, or we may be afraid to move forward, fearing that we will lose the connection to what we have lost. But we know that You call us to let go and to trust in Your plan for our future.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to let go by giving us the wisdom to understand what we can and cannot control. Help us to see that while we cannot change the past or bring back what we have lost, we can choose how we respond to our loss and how we move forward with our lives. Give us the grace to accept what we cannot change and to focus on what we can.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to let go by giving us the courage to move forward with faith and hope. Help us to understand that moving forward does not mean forgetting our loss or the people we have loved, but rather honoring their memory by living our lives fully and with purpose. Give us the strength to take one step at a time, trusting in Your guidance and Your love.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to let go by helping us to see that letting go is not a sign of weakness or betrayal, but a sign of strength and trust. Help us to understand that when we let go, we are not abandoning our loved ones or our memories, but rather making room for new possibilities and new blessings in our lives.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to let go and move forward. May they too find the courage and strength they need through Your grace and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your liberating power to others, sharing the freedom and hope that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to let go and move forward with faith and hope. Thank You for Your love and Your promise to make all things new.</p>
