              <p className="mb-4">Healing and Merciful Father, we come before You today seeking to embrace Your healing grace and to allow You to mend our broken hearts. We acknowledge that You are the God who heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds, the One who can restore what has been lost and bring beauty from ashes. You are the Divine Physician who can heal even the deepest wounds of our souls.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that after experiencing loss, our hearts can feel broken, wounded, and beyond repair. We may feel as if the pain will never end, as if we will never be whole again, or as if our lives will never be the same. But we know that Your healing grace is more powerful than any wound and that You can restore us to wholeness.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to embrace Your healing grace by opening our hearts to receive Your love and comfort. Help us to understand that healing is not about forgetting our loss or pretending that everything is okay, but about allowing Your grace to work in our hearts and bring us peace. Give us the courage to be vulnerable with You and to allow You to touch our wounded places.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to embrace Your healing grace by giving us the faith to believe that healing is possible through Your power. Help us to understand that Your grace can mend our broken hearts, restore our hope, and bring us peace even in the midst of our pain. Give us the patience to allow Your healing to work in Your time and in Your way.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to embrace Your healing grace by helping us to see that healing often comes through the love and support of others. Help us to be open to receiving comfort from family, friends, and community, and to understand that these relationships can be instruments of Your healing grace in our lives.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking Your healing grace. May they too find the courage to embrace Your love and allow You to work in their hearts. Help us to be instruments of Your healing grace to others, sharing the comfort and peace that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to embrace Your healing grace and find restoration in Your love. Thank You for Your healing grace and Your mercy. We embrace Your grace, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
