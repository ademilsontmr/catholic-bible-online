              <p className="mb-4">Faithful and Promising Father, we come before You today seeking to find hope and comfort in Your promises of eternal life and reunion. We acknowledge that You are the God who keeps all His promises, the One who has promised to never leave us or forsake us, to work all things together for our good, and to give us a future and a hope. You are the God of resurrection and new life.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that in the midst of our grief and loss, it can be difficult to find hope and to believe in a better future. We may feel as if our world has ended, as if there is no reason to go on, or as if we will never find joy again. But we know that Your promises are true and that You can bring hope even in the darkest times.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find hope in Your promises by reminding us of Your promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ. Help us to understand that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with You. Give us the hope to believe that we will be reunited with our loved ones in heaven, where there will be no more tears, no more pain, and no more separation.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to find hope in Your promises by giving us the faith to believe in Your promise to work all things together for our good. Help us to understand that even our loss and suffering can be used by You to bring about good in our lives and in the lives of others. Give us the hope to believe that You can bring beauty from ashes and joy from mourning.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to find hope in Your promises by helping us to focus on Your promise to give us a future and a hope. Help us to understand that our lives are not over, but that You have new plans and new purposes for us. Give us the courage to look forward to the future with hope and expectation.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking hope in Your promises. May they too find comfort and encouragement in Your faithfulness and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your promises to others, sharing the hope and confidence that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to find hope in Your promises and comfort in Your faithfulness. Thank You for Your promises and Your faithfulness. We find our hope in You, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
