                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Most Loving and Compassionate Father, we come before You today with hearts that are heavy with grief and minds that are clouded with pain. We acknowledge that You are the God who understands suffering intimately, the One who has experienced the depths of human pain through Your Son, Jesus Christ, who wept at the tomb of Lazarus and who knows the agony of loss and separation.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that loss and grief are among the most difficult experiences we face in this life. Whether we have lost a loved one through death, experienced the end of a relationship, lost a job, health, or dreams, or faced any other significant loss, the pain can feel overwhelming and all-consuming. We may feel as if our world has been shattered and that we will never be whole again.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to acknowledge and accept our grief and pain, rather than trying to suppress or ignore it. Help us to understand that grief is a natural and necessary response to loss, and that it is okay to feel sad, angry, confused, or even numb. Give us the courage to be honest about our feelings and to bring them to You in prayer.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to see that acknowledging our grief is not a sign of weakness, but of strength and honesty. Help us to understand that when we bring our pain to You, we are not burdening You, but rather allowing You to carry our burdens and comfort us in our sorrow. Teach us to trust that You can handle all our emotions and that You want to walk with us through this difficult time.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to remember that we are not alone in our grief. You are always with us, and You understand our pain better than anyone else. Help us to find comfort in knowing that You see our tears, hear our cries, and feel our pain. Give us the grace to believe that You are working for our good, even in the midst of our suffering.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are grieving losses of their own. May they too find the courage to acknowledge their pain and bring it to You. Help us to be instruments of Your comfort to others, sharing the hope and peace that we find in trusting You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to acknowledge our grief honestly and to find comfort in Your love. Thank You for Your understanding and Your compassion. We place our broken hearts in Your hands, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
