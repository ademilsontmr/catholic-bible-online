              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Peaceful and Accepting Father, we come before You today on this final day of our novena, seeking the grace to live in peace and acceptance, trusting in Your love and Your plan for our lives. We acknowledge that You are the God of peace who can give us peace that surpasses all understanding, the One who can help us to accept what we cannot change and to find contentment in Your love.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that true healing after loss involves coming to a place of peace and acceptance. This does not mean that we forget our loss or that we no longer feel pain, but rather that we learn to live with our loss in a way that brings us peace and allows us to move forward with hope and purpose. We know that this kind of peace and acceptance can only come through Your grace.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to live in peace by giving us the grace to accept what we cannot change. Help us to understand that acceptance is not about giving up or resigning ourselves to a life of pain, but about finding peace in the midst of our circumstances and trusting in Your plan for our lives. Give us the wisdom to know the difference between what we can change and what we must accept.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to live in acceptance by giving us the faith to trust in Your love and Your goodness. Help us to understand that even in the midst of our loss and pain, You love us deeply and are working for our good. Give us the peace that comes from knowing that we are held in Your loving arms and that nothing can separate us from Your love.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to live in peace and acceptance by helping us to focus on the blessings that remain in our lives and the new possibilities that lie ahead. Help us to understand that while we have experienced loss, we still have much to be grateful for and much to look forward to. Give us the grace to find joy in the present moment and hope for the future.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking peace and acceptance in their lives. May they too find the grace and strength they need through Your love and Your peace. Help us to be witnesses of Your peace to others, sharing the tranquility and contentment that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to live in peace and acceptance, trusting in Your love. Thank You for Your peace and Your promise to be with us always. We live in Your peace, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
