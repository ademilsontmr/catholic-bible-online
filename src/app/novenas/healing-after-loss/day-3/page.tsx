              <p className="mb-4">Almighty and Wise Father, we come before You today seeking the grace to trust in Your plan, even when we cannot understand our loss and the pain it has caused. We acknowledge that You are the God who works all things together for good for those who love You, the One who has a perfect plan for each of our lives and who knows exactly what we need and when we need it.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that one of the most difficult aspects of loss and grief is the feeling that our lives have been disrupted, that our plans have been shattered, and that we have lost control over our future. We may question why this loss happened, why we are suffering, and what purpose there could possibly be in our pain. But we know that You have a plan that is greater than our understanding.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to trust in Your plan by reminding us that You are in control of all things, even when our world feels chaotic and out of control. Help us to see that Your plan is not limited by our understanding or our circumstances, but is perfect and complete. Give us the grace to believe that You are working all things together for our good, even in the midst of our suffering.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to trust in Your plan by giving us the faith to believe that our loss, though painful, is not the end of our story. Help us to understand that You can bring good out of even the most difficult situations, and that Your plan for our lives is still unfolding. Give us the hope to believe that there is meaning and purpose in our suffering.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to trust in Your plan by helping us to see that our loss can be a part of Your greater plan for our lives and for the lives of others. Help us to understand that through our pain, we can grow in compassion, wisdom, and faith, and that we can become instruments of Your love and comfort to others who are suffering.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to trust in Your plan. May they too find the faith and hope they need to believe in Your goodness and Your love. Help us to be witnesses of Your faithfulness to others, sharing the trust and confidence that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific loss and grief intentions here). We trust that You will help us to trust in Your plan and find peace in Your wisdom. Thank You for Your plan and Your love. We trust in Your plan, knowing that You are faithful and will never fail us.</p>
