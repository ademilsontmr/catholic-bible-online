              The Novena for Healing After Loss is a gentle and compassionate spiritual practice designed to help you find 
              healing and peace after experiencing loss, grief, and bereavement. Loss comes in many forms - the death of a 
              loved one, the end of a relationship, the loss of a job, health, or dreams - and each type of loss can leave 
              us feeling broken, alone, and overwhelmed by grief.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              This novena invites you to bring all your pain, grief, and questions to God, who understands suffering intimately 
              through His Son, Jesus Christ. Through nine days of focused prayer, you will learn to acknowledge your grief, 
              find comfort in God's love, trust in His plan, embrace His healing grace, and discover hope for the future.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Whether you're grieving the loss of a loved one, dealing with the end of a relationship, or struggling with 
              any other type of loss, this novena will guide you on a journey toward healing, acceptance, and renewed hope.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Loss and grief are natural human experiences that occur when we experience the death of a loved one, the end of 
              a relationship, the loss of a job, health, or dreams, or any other significant change that takes away something 
              or someone important to us. Grief is the emotional, physical, and spiritual response to loss.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic understanding of loss and grief recognizes that these experiences are part of our human journey, 
              but God wants to walk with us through our pain and bring us healing and comfort. Through prayer, the sacraments, 
              and God's grace, we can find meaning in our suffering and hope for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novena helps you to bring your grief and loss to God, who understands suffering intimately. He knows your 
              pain and wants to comfort you, heal your broken heart, and help you find peace and hope in the midst of your loss.
