                <strong>Heavenly Father,</strong> we thank You for the precious gift of life that You have given to each of us.
                We praise You for creating every human being in Your image and likeness, from the moment of conception.
                Help us to rejoice in every new life and to celebrate the gift of pregnancy as a blessing from You.

                Give us the grace to welcome new life with open hearts and loving arms.

                We ask that our government and all leaders will bend to Your will and protect the most vulnerable among us,
                especially the child in the womb. May this event be an inspiration to those who march, to those who see it,

                Today we pray for joy in celebrating the gift of life and new beginnings.
                Joy is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to understanding His plan for life.

              <p className="mb-4">
                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to give us joy.
                As our Father, He knows exactly what we need and when we need it, especially when it comes to celebrating life.

                The focus on joy for life reminds us that every human being is a cause for celebration.
                God calls us to rejoice in every pregnancy and to see every child as a blessing from Him.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our joy in Him.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always give us joy and help us celebrate life.

              <p>
                Remember that God's joy is not limited by time or circumstance.
                He is perpetually ready to give us joy, and we can trust completely in His divine love and care.
