                Today we pray for the intercession of saints and angels for the unborn.
                Intercession is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to understanding His plan for life.

                God is our Father, who loves us with a perfect love and is always ready to send His heavenly helpers.

              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                As we continue this novena, let us ask God to increase our trust in His heavenly helpers.
                Let us ask Him to help us turn to Him with confidence in every need,
                knowing that He will always send His angels and saints to protect life.
