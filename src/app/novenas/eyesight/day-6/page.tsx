              <p className="mb-4">Today we pray for doctors who care for patients in danger of losing eyesight. Ophthalmologists, optometrists, and other eye care professionals play a crucial role in preserving and restoring vision. Sirach 38:1-2 reminds us that the gift of healing comes from the Most High and that we should honor physicians for their services. These medical professionals have dedicated years to studying and training to help people with vision problems. They often work long hours and face complex medical challenges in their efforts to save and restore vision. Let us pray that these medical professionals will be guided by God in their work, that they will have wisdom and skill in treating their patients, and that they will be compassionate and caring in their approach to those facing vision loss.</p>
