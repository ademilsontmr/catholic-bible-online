                Dear Lord, we thank You and praise You for the many gifts You have given us, especially the gift of our sight. Please help all who are in danger of losing the precious gift of sight.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Prayer for Submission to God's Will:</strong><br/>
                It can be very difficult for us to accept suffering in our lives. The loss of eyesight can be a very heavy cross to accept. Those who are losing their eyesight are in great need of grace to grow in submission to Your will.

                We ask You to bless, strengthen and heal all who are in danger of losing their eyesight, and we particularly ask You today to help us grow in submission to Your will! Help us to make growth in virtue a priority in our lives. Help us to grow in trust in Your loving providence for us. And I especially ask in this novena (mention your intentions here).

                Today we pray for us to grow in submission to God's will when facing vision loss. Accepting the possibility or reality of vision loss can be one of the most difficult challenges we face.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Luke 22:42 shows us Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He asked the Father to take the cup of suffering from Him, but ultimately submitted to the Father's will. This is a model for us when we face difficult circumstances like vision loss.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We can and should pray for healing and preservation of our vision, but we must also be willing to accept God's will if it is different from our own. This submission is not passive resignation, but active trust in God's love and wisdom.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Let us pray that we will find the grace to submit to God's will while maintaining hope in His love.
