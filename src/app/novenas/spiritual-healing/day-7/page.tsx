              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Most Merciful and Forgiving Father, we come before You today seeking to fully embrace Your infinite divine mercy and to receive Your complete forgiveness for all our sins. We acknowledge that You are the God of mercy, the One who is always ready to forgive, always ready to welcome us back, and always ready to pour out Your mercy upon us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that embracing Your divine mercy requires us to acknowledge our sins, to repent of them, to ask for Your forgiveness, and to believe that You have truly forgiven us. We know that this can be difficult because of our pride, our shame, our guilt, and our tendency to hold onto our sins even after You have forgiven them.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that Your mercy is not something we earn or deserve, but a free gift that You offer to us out of Your infinite love. Help us to see that Your mercy is greater than any sin we have committed, and that there is nothing we can do that will make You stop loving us or stop offering us Your mercy.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to help us to embrace Your divine mercy with open hearts and grateful spirits. Help us to believe that You have truly forgiven us and to let go of the guilt and shame that we often carry even after receiving Your forgiveness. Teach us to accept Your mercy as the precious gift that it is and to share that mercy with others.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that embracing Your mercy is not just about receiving forgiveness for our sins, but about allowing Your mercy to transform our hearts and make us more merciful toward others. Help us to see that Your mercy is not just for us, but for all people, and that we are called to be instruments of Your mercy in the world.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling to embrace Your mercy. May they too find the courage and faith to accept Your forgiveness and to experience the freedom and joy that comes from embracing Your divine mercy.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific spiritual healing intentions here). We trust that You will help us to fully embrace Your divine mercy and to experience the freedom and joy that comes from knowing that we are forgiven and loved. Thank You for Your infinite mercy and Your promise to always forgive those who turn to You.</p>
