                <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Almighty and Powerful Father, we come before You today seeking freedom from the spiritual bondage that has held us captive and prevented us from experiencing the fullness of Your love and grace. We acknowledge that You are the God who sets captives free, the One who breaks every chain and opens every prison door.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that spiritual bondage can take many forms - addiction to sin, unhealthy attachments, negative thought patterns, unforgiveness, fear, doubt, and many other chains that keep us from living in the freedom that You have won for us through Your Son, Jesus Christ. We know that these chains are not from You, but from the enemy who wants to keep us in slavery.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to identify the specific chains that are binding us and preventing us from experiencing spiritual freedom. Give us the courage to be honest about our spiritual struggles and the humility to ask for Your help in breaking free from them. Help us to understand that we cannot break these chains on our own, but that You have the power to set us free.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to break every chain that is holding us back from You. Break the chains of addiction, of unforgiveness, of fear, of doubt, of pride, of self-sufficiency, and of any other spiritual bondage that is preventing us from experiencing the fullness of Your love and grace.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that true spiritual freedom is not the freedom to do whatever we want, but the freedom to become who You created us to be. Help us to see that spiritual bondage is often the result of choosing our own will over Yours, and that true freedom comes from surrendering our will to Yours.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are struggling with spiritual bondage. May they too find freedom through Your power and grace. Help us to be witnesses of Your liberating love to others, sharing the hope and freedom that we find in You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific spiritual healing intentions here). We trust that You will break every chain that is binding us and set us free to live in the fullness of Your love and grace. Thank You for Your power and Your promise to set captives free.</p>
