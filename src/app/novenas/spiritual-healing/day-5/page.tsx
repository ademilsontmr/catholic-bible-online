              <p className="mb-4">Compassionate and Healing Father, we come before You today with hearts that have been wounded by spiritual struggles, by sin, by doubt, by spiritual attacks, and by the many other forces that can cause deep spiritual wounds. We acknowledge that You are the Divine Physician who can heal even the deepest spiritual wounds and restore our souls to health and wholeness.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that spiritual wounds can be just as painful and debilitating as physical or emotional wounds, and sometimes even more so. These wounds can affect our relationship with You, our ability to trust, our capacity for love, and our overall spiritual well-being. We know that You understand these wounds intimately and that You have the power to heal them completely.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to identify the specific spiritual wounds that we are carrying and to bring them to You for healing. Give us the courage to be honest about our spiritual pain and the faith to believe that You can and will heal us. Help us to understand that spiritual healing is a process that takes time and requires our cooperation with Your grace.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to heal all our spiritual wounds - the wounds of sin, the wounds of doubt, the wounds of spiritual attacks, the wounds of broken relationships, and any other spiritual wounds that are affecting our relationship with You and our spiritual growth.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that spiritual wounds often come from the enemy who wants to separate us from You and prevent us from experiencing the fullness of Your love and grace. Help us to see that these wounds are not a sign of Your absence or Your lack of care, but rather opportunities for You to demonstrate Your healing power and love.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are carrying spiritual wounds. May they too find healing through Your love and grace. Help us to be instruments of Your healing love to others, sharing the hope and peace that we find in Your healing touch.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific spiritual healing intentions here). We trust that You will heal all our spiritual wounds and restore our souls to health and wholeness. Thank You for Your healing power and Your promise to restore what has been broken.</p>
