              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">Wise and Loving Father, we come before You today seeking to discover Your purpose for our spiritual life and to understand the unique mission that You have given to each of us. We acknowledge that You are the God who has a plan for each of our lives, a purpose that is uniquely suited to our gifts, our experiences, and our relationship with You.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we recognize that finding our purpose in our spiritual journey can be challenging, especially when we are going through difficult times or when we feel lost or confused about our direction. We know that You want us to discover our purpose not just for our own benefit, but for the benefit of others and for Your glory.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that our spiritual purpose is not about achieving great things or becoming famous, but about becoming the person You created us to be and doing the work You have prepared for us to do. Help us to see that our purpose is often found in the small, everyday acts of love and service that we perform for others.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we ask You to reveal Your purpose for our spiritual life and to give us the wisdom and courage to follow that purpose wherever it leads us. Help us to understand that our purpose may change and evolve as we grow in our relationship with You, and that we need to be open to Your guidance and direction.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We pray that You would help us to understand that finding our purpose is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process of discernment and discovery. Help us to be patient with ourselves and with You as we seek to understand Your plan for our lives. Teach us to listen for Your voice in prayer, in reading Your Word, in the counsel of others, and in the circumstances of our lives.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">Lord, we also pray for all those who are seeking to discover their spiritual purpose. May they too find clarity and direction through Your guidance and love. Help us to support and encourage one another as we seek to fulfill the purposes You have given to each of us.</p>

              <p className="mb-4">We especially ask in this novena for (mention your specific spiritual healing intentions here). We trust that You will reveal Your purpose for our spiritual life and give us the grace to fulfill that purpose with joy and faithfulness. Thank You for Your wisdom and Your promise to guide us in all our ways.</p>
