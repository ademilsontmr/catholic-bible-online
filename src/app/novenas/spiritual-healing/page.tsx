            <p className="mb-4">
              Spiritual healing is the process of recovering from spiritual wounds, dryness, and distance from God through prayer, 
              sacraments, and divine grace. It involves acknowledging our spiritual struggles, opening our hearts to God's mercy, 
              and allowing Him to restore our relationship with Him and transform our souls.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Catholic understanding of spiritual healing recognizes that we are spiritual beings created for communion with God. 
              Through prayer, the sacraments, and God's grace, we can find healing for even the deepest spiritual wounds and experience 
              the renewal and transformation that God desires for us.

            <p>
              This novena helps you to bring your spiritual struggles to God, who is the Divine Physician of souls. He knows your spiritual 
              pain intimately and wants to heal you completely, restoring your relationship with Him and helping you to live in the freedom 
              and joy of His love.
